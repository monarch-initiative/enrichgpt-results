        Enriched Terms: MAPK cascade; PI3K-Akt signaling pathway; regulation of cell

        Mechanism: The enriched terms suggest that the common function of the listed
        genes is to regulate cellular processes related to signal transduction and
        cell cycle/apoptosis. The MAPK cascade is a crucial signaling pathway that
        controls the expression of genes required for cellular proliferation, differentiation,
        and survival. PI3K-Akt signaling pathway controls cell survival, growth, and
        metabolism. The enriched term "regulation of cell proliferation" suggests
        that the listed genes contribute to regulating the balance between cell growth
        and division. These genes could affect the rate of cellular proliferation,
        arresting or promoting the cell cycle or modulating apoptotic signal transduction.


        Hypothesis: The listed genes are involved in different stages of signal transduction
        pathways that ultimately converge on either the MAPK cascade or PI3K-Akt signaling
        pathway, which regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.
        The genes identified under enriched term "regulation of cell proliferation"
        might work as positive or negative regulators of cell growth and death signals.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.
