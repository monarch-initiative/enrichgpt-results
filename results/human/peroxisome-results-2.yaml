        Here are the gene summaries:



        PEX1: This gene encodes a member of the AAA ATPase family, a large group of
        ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities. This protein is cytoplasmic
        but is often anchored to a peroxisomal membrane where it forms a heteromeric
        complex and plays a role in the import of proteins into peroxisomes and peroxisome
        biogenesis. Mutations in this gene have been associated with complementation
        group 1 peroxisomal disorders such as neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile
        Refsum disease, and Zellweger syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants
        have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]


        PEX2: This gene encodes an integral peroxisomal membrane protein required
        for peroxisome biogenesis. The protein is thought to be involved in peroxisomal
        matrix protein import. Mutations in this gene result in one form of Zellweger
        syndrome and infantile Refsum disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants encoding the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PEX3: The product of this gene is involved in peroxisome biosynthesis and
        integrity. It assembles membrane vesicles before the matrix proteins are translocated.
        Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional
        peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically
        heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple
        defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a
        heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more
        than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation
        groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all
        PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal
        matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause Zellweger
        syndrome (ZWS). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]


        PEX5: The product of this gene binds to the C-terminal PTS1-type tripeptide
        peroxisomal targeting signal (SKL-type) and plays an essential role in peroxisomal
        protein import. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly
        of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are
        a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases
        characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal
        biogenesis disorders are a heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation
        groups and with more than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into
        particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients
        vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or
        more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in
        this gene are a cause of neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), a cause of
        Zellweger syndrome (ZWS) as well as may be a cause of infantile Refsum disease
        (IRD). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms
        have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]


        PEX6: This gene encodes a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse
        cellular activities) family of ATPases. This member is a predominantly cytoplasmic
        protein, which plays a direct role in peroxisomal protein import and is required
        for PTS1 (peroxisomal targeting signal 1, a C-terminal tripeptide of the sequence
        ser-lys-leu) receptor activity. Mutations in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis
        disorders of complementation group 4 and complementation group 6. Several
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
        [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        PEX7: This gene encodes the cytosolic receptor for the set of peroxisomal
        matrix enzymes targeted to the organelle by the peroxisome targeting signal
        2 (PTS2). Defects in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs),
        which are characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. There
        are at least 14 complementation groups for PBDs, with more than one phenotype
        being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although
        the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit
        a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins
        into the organelle. Defects in this gene have been associated with PBD complementation
        group 11 (PBD-CG11) disorders, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1
        (RCDP1), and Refsum disease (RD). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        PEX1: This gene encodes a member of the AAA ATPase family, a large group of
        ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities. This protein is cytoplasmic
        but is often anchored to a peroxisomal membrane where it forms a heteromeric
        complex and plays a role in the import of proteins into peroxisomes and peroxisome
        biogenesis. Mutations in this gene have been associated with complementation
        group 1 peroxisomal disorders such as neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile
        Refsum disease, and Zellweger syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants
        have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]


        PEX2: This gene encodes an integral peroxisomal membrane protein required
        for peroxisome biogenesis. The protein is thought to be involved in peroxisomal
        matrix protein import. Mutations in this gene result in one form of Zellweger
        syndrome and infantile Refsum disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants encoding the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PEX3: The product of this gene is involved in peroxisome biosynthesis and
        integrity. It assembles membrane vesicles before the matrix proteins are translocated.
        Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional
        peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically
        heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple
        defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a
        heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more
        than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation
        groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all
        PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal
        matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause Zellweger
        syndrome (ZWS). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]


        PEX5: The product of this gene binds to the C-terminal PTS1-type tripeptide
        peroxisomal targeting signal (SKL-type) and plays an essential role in peroxisomal
        protein import. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly
        of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are
        a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases
        characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal
        biogenesis disorders are a heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation
        groups and with more than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into
        particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients
        vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or
        more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in
        this gene are a cause of neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), a cause of
        Zellweger syndrome (ZWS) as well as may be a cause of infantile Refsum disease
        (IRD). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms
        have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]


        PEX6: This gene encodes a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse
        cellular activities) family of ATPases. This member is a predominantly cytoplasmic
        protein, which plays a direct role in peroxisomal protein import and is required
        for PTS1 (peroxisomal targeting signal 1, a C-terminal tripeptide of the sequence
        ser-lys-leu) receptor activity. Mutations in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis
        disorders of complementation group 4 and complementation group 6. Several
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
        [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        PEX7: This gene encodes the cytosolic receptor for the set of peroxisomal
        matrix enzymes targeted to the organelle by the peroxisome targeting signal
        2 (PTS2). Defects in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs),
        which are characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. There
        are at least 14 complementation groups for PBDs, with more than one phenotype
        being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although
        the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit
        a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins
        into the organelle. Defects in this gene have been associated with PBD complementation
        group 11 (PBD-CG11) disorders, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1
        (RCDP1), and Refsum disease (RD). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        PEX1: This gene encodes a member of the AAA ATPase family, a large group of
        ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities. This protein is cytoplasmic
        but is often anchored to a peroxisomal membrane where it forms a heteromeric
        complex and plays a role in the import of proteins into peroxisomes and peroxisome
        biogenesis. Mutations in this gene have been associated with complementation
        group 1 peroxisomal disorders such as neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile
        Refsum disease, and Zellweger syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants
        have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]


        PEX2: This gene encodes an integral peroxisomal membrane protein required
        for peroxisome biogenesis. The protein is thought to be involved in peroxisomal
        matrix protein import. Mutations in this gene result in one form of Zellweger
        syndrome and infantile Refsum disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants encoding the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PEX3: The product of this gene is involved in peroxisome biosynthesis and
        integrity. It assembles membrane vesicles before the matrix proteins are translocated.
        Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional
        peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically
        heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple
        defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a
        heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more
        than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation
        groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all
        PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal
        matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause Zellweger
        syndrome (ZWS). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]


        PEX5: The product of this gene binds to the C-terminal PTS1-type tripeptide
        peroxisomal targeting signal (SKL-type) and plays an essential role in peroxisomal
        protein import. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly
        of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are
        a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases
        characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal
        biogenesis disorders are a heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation
        groups and with more than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into
        particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients
        vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or
        more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in
        this gene are a cause of neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), a cause of
        Zellweger syndrome (ZWS) as well as may be a cause of infantile Refsum disease
        (IRD). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms
        have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]


        PEX6: This gene encodes a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse
        cellular activities) family of ATPases. This member is a predominantly cytoplasmic
        protein, which plays a direct role in peroxisomal protein import and is required
        for PTS1 (peroxisomal targeting signal 1, a C-terminal tripeptide of the sequence
        ser-lys-leu) receptor activity. Mutations in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis
        disorders of complementation group 4 and complementation group 6. Several
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
        [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        PEX7: This gene encodes the cytosolic receptor for the set of peroxisomal
        matrix enzymes targeted to the organelle by the peroxisome targeting signal
        2 (PTS2). Defects in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs),
        which are characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. There
        are at least 14 complementation groups for PBDs, with more than one phenotype
        being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although
        the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit
        a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins
        into the organelle. Defects in this gene have been associated with PBD complementation
        group 11 (PBD-CG11) disorders, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1
        (RCDP1), and Refsum disease (RD). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

        Mechanism: The peroxisome biogenesis process involves the formation of a membrane-bound
        organelle that contains enzymes involved in various metabolic pathways, including
        fatty acid degradation, plasmalogen biosynthesis, and bile acid synthesis.
        Peroxisomes play a vital role in cellular metabolism and are involved in various
        processes such as lipid metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification,
        and the biosynthesis of specific signaling molecules.


        Enriched Terms: Peroxisome organization; Peroxisome biogenesis; Peroxisome
        fission.


        Hypothesis: The genes PEX2, PEX3, PEX6, PEX7, and PEX1 are all involved in
        peroxisome biogenesis. These genes encode proteins that are required for the
        assembly of peroxisomes and their proper function. Specifically, PEX1 and
        PEX6 encode ATPases involved in the translocation of peroxisomal matrix proteins
        into the organelle, while PEX2, PEX3, and PEX7 have roles in the early stages
        of peroxisome biogenesis, including membrane assembly and division. The enriched'

        Peroxisomes play a vital role in cellular metabolism and are involved in various
        processes such as lipid metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification,
        and the biosynthesis of specific signaling molecules.



        Hypothesis:  The genes PEX2, PEX3, PEX6, PEX7, and PEX1 are all involved in
        peroxisome biogenesis. These genes encode proteins that are required for the
        assembly of peroxisomes and their proper function. Specifically, PEX1 and
        PEX6 encode ATPases involved in the translocation of peroxisomal matrix proteins
        into the organelle, while PEX2, PEX3, and PEX7 have roles in the early stages
        of peroxisome biogenesis, including membrane assembly and division. The enriched'

        Here are the gene summaries:



        PEX6: This gene encodes a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse
        cellular activities) family of ATPases. This member is a predominantly cytoplasmic
        protein, which plays a direct role in peroxisomal protein import and is required
        for PTS1 (peroxisomal targeting signal 1, a C-terminal tripeptide of the sequence
        ser-lys-leu) receptor activity. Mutations in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis
        disorders of complementation group 4 and complementation group 6. Several
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
        [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        PEX2: This gene encodes an integral peroxisomal membrane protein required
        for peroxisome biogenesis. The protein is thought to be involved in peroxisomal
        matrix protein import. Mutations in this gene result in one form of Zellweger
        syndrome and infantile Refsum disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants encoding the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PEX3: The product of this gene is involved in peroxisome biosynthesis and
        integrity. It assembles membrane vesicles before the matrix proteins are translocated.
        Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional
        peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically
        heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple
        defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a
        heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more
        than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation
        groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all
        PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal
        matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause Zellweger
        syndrome (ZWS). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]


        PEX7: This gene encodes the cytosolic receptor for the set of peroxisomal
        matrix enzymes targeted to the organelle by the peroxisome targeting signal
        2 (PTS2). Defects in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs),
        which are characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. There
        are at least 14 complementation groups for PBDs, with more than one phenotype
        being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although
        the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit
        a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins
        into the organelle. Defects in this gene have been associated with PBD complementation
        group 11 (PBD-CG11) disorders, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1

        PEX1: This gene encodes a member of the AAA ATPase family, a large group of
        ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities. This protein is cytoplasmic
        but is often anchored to a peroxisomal membrane where it forms a heteromeric

        Here are the gene summaries:



        PEX6: This gene encodes a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse
        cellular activities) family of ATPases. This member is a predominantly cytoplasmic
        protein, which plays a direct role in peroxisomal protein import and is required
        for PTS1 (peroxisomal targeting signal 1, a C-terminal tripeptide of the sequence
        ser-lys-leu) receptor activity. Mutations in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis
        disorders of complementation group 4 and complementation group 6. Several
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
        [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        PEX2: This gene encodes an integral peroxisomal membrane protein required
        for peroxisome biogenesis. The protein is thought to be involved in peroxisomal
        matrix protein import. Mutations in this gene result in one form of Zellweger
        syndrome and infantile Refsum disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants encoding the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PEX3: The product of this gene is involved in peroxisome biosynthesis and
        integrity. It assembles membrane vesicles before the matrix proteins are translocated.
        Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional
        peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically
        heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple
        defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a
        heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more
        than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation
        groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all
        PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal
        matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause Zellweger
        syndrome (ZWS). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]


        PEX7: This gene encodes the cytosolic receptor for the set of peroxisomal
        matrix enzymes targeted to the organelle by the peroxisome targeting signal
        2 (PTS2). Defects in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs),
        which are characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. There
        are at least 14 complementation groups for PBDs, with more than one phenotype
        being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although
        the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit
        a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins
        into the organelle. Defects in this gene have been associated with PBD complementation
        group 11 (PBD-CG11) disorders, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1
        (RCDP1), and Refsum disease (RD). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]


        PEX1: This gene encodes a member of the AAA ATPase family, a large group of
        ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities. This protein is cytoplasmic
        but is often anchored to a peroxisomal membrane where it forms a heteromeric
        complex and plays a role in the import of proteins into peroxisomes and peroxisome
        biogenesis. Mutations in this gene have been associated with complementation
        group 1 peroxisomal disorders such as neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile
        Refsum disease, and Zellweger syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants
        have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Here are the gene summaries:



        PEX6: This gene encodes a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse
        cellular activities) family of ATPases. This member is a predominantly cytoplasmic
        protein, which plays a direct role in peroxisomal protein import and is required
        for PTS1 (peroxisomal targeting signal 1, a C-terminal tripeptide of the sequence
        ser-lys-leu) receptor activity. Mutations in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis
        disorders of complementation group 4 and complementation group 6. Several
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
        [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        PEX2: This gene encodes an integral peroxisomal membrane protein required
        for peroxisome biogenesis. The protein is thought to be involved in peroxisomal
        matrix protein import. Mutations in this gene result in one form of Zellweger
        syndrome and infantile Refsum disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants encoding the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PEX3: The product of this gene is involved in peroxisome biosynthesis and
        integrity. It assembles membrane vesicles before the matrix proteins are translocated.
        Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional
        peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically
        heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple
        defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a
        heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more
        than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation
        groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all
        PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal
        matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause Zellweger
        syndrome (ZWS). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]


        PEX7: This gene encodes the cytosolic receptor for the set of peroxisomal
        matrix enzymes targeted to the organelle by the peroxisome targeting signal
        2 (PTS2). Defects in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs),
        which are characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. There
        are at least 14 complementation groups for PBDs, with more than one phenotype
        being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although
        the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit
        a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins
        into the organelle. Defects in this gene have been associated with PBD complementation
        group 11 (PBD-CG11) disorders, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1
        (RCDP1), and Refsum disease (RD). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]


        PEX1: This gene encodes a member of the AAA ATPase family, a large group of
        ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities. This protein is cytoplasmic
        but is often anchored to a peroxisomal membrane where it forms a heteromeric
        complex and plays a role in the import of proteins into peroxisomes and peroxisome
        biogenesis. Mutations in this gene have been associated with complementation
        group 1 peroxisomal disorders such as neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile
        Refsum disease, and Zellweger syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants
        have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]
