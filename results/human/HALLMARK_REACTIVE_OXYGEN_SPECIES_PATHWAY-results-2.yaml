      response_text: '

        This list of genes is enriched for terms related to oxidative stress, metabolism,
        and immune system function. Specifically, the genes represent proteins involved
        in oxygen-sensing, anti-oxidation, redox regulation, DNA repair, the stress
        response, and cytokine signaling.


        Mechanism:

        The underlying biological mechanism of the gene list is likely the cellular
        response to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is a term used to describe
        a disruption in the balance of antioxidant molecules and reactive oxygen species.
        These reactive molecules can cause damage to the cell, and thus the relevant
        genes likely help the cell to counteract this damage by regulating redox status,
        mediating oxidant stress, and participating in DNA repair and other defense
        mechanisms. Additionally, some of these genes are involved in cytokine signaling,
        which helps to aid the immune system in defending against potential oxidative
        insults.'

        against oxidative stress. Catalase is a heme enzyme that is present in the
        peroxisome of nearly all aerobic cells. Catalase converts the reactive oxygen
        species hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen and thereby mitigates the toxic
        effects of hydrogen peroxide. Oxidative stress is hypothesized to play a rol...


        CDKN2D: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the INK4 family of
        cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. This protein has been shown to form a

        dependen...


        SOD1: The protein encoded by this gene binds copper and zinc ions and is one

        which vary in cellular location and substrate specificity. This isozyme is
        secreted, and is abundantly found in plasma. Downregulation of expression
        of this gene by promoter hypermethylation has been observed in a wide spectrum
        of human malignancies, including thyroid cancer, hepatocell...

        or two active cysteines in their active site. This gene undergoes alternative
        splicing to produce multiple isoforms, one of which is ubiquitously expressed
        and localizes to mitochondria,...

        the myelin sheath of oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells in the nervous system.
        However, MBP-related transcripts are also present in the bone marrow and the
        immune system. These mRNAs arise from the long MBP gene (otherwise called
        "Golli-MBP") that contains 3 additional exons located upstream of the classic
        MBP exons. Alternative splicing from the Golli and the MBP transcription start
        sites gives rise to 2 sets of MBP-related transcripts and gene products. The
        Golli mRNAs contain 3 exons un...


        GLRX: This gene encodes a member of the glutaredoxin family. The encoded protein
        is a cytoplasmic enzyme catalyzing the reversible reduction of glutathione-protein
        mixed disulfides. This enzyme highly contributes to the antioxidant defense
        system. It is crucial for several signalling path...


        TXN: The protein encoded by this gene acts as a homodimer and is involved
        in many redox reactions. The encoded protein is active in the reversible S-nitrosylation
        of cysteines in certain proteins, which is part o...


        FES: This gene encodes the human cellular counterpart of a feline sarcoma
        retrovirus protein with transforming capabilities. The gene product has tyrosine-specific
        protein kinase activity and that activity is required for maintenance of cellular
        transformation. Its chromosomal location has linked it to a specif...


        GCLM: Glutamate-cysteine ligase, also known as gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase,
        is the first rate limiting enzyme of glutathione synthesis. The enzyme consists
        of two subunits, a heavy catalytic subunit and a light regulatory subunit....


        NDUFS2: The protein encoded by this gene is a core subunit of the mitochondrial
        membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (complex I). Mammalian mitochondrial
        complex I is composed of at least 43 different subunits, 7 of which are encoded
        by the mitochondrial genome, and the rest are the products of nuclear genes.
        The iron-sulfur protein fraction of complex I is made up of 7 subuni...


        FTL: This gene encodes the light subunit of the ferritin protein. Ferritin
        is the major intracellular iron storage protein in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
        It is composed of 24 subunits of the heavy and light ferritin chains. Variation
        in ferritin subunit composition may affect the rates of iron uptake and release
        in diffe...


        PRDX1: This gene encodes a member of the peroxiredoxin family of antioxidant
        enzymes, which reduce hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides. The encoded
        protein may play an antioxidant protective role in cells, and may contribute
        to the antiviral activi...


        SCAF4: This gene likely encodes a member of the arginine/serine-rich splicing
        factor family. A similar protein in Rat appears to bind the large subunit
        of RNA polymerase II...


        GPX4: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the glutathione peroxidase
        family, members of which catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, organic
        hydroperoxides and lipid hydroperoxides, and thereby protect cells against
        oxidative damage. Several isozymes of this gene family exist in vertebrates,
        which vary in cellular location and substrate specificity. This isozyme has
        a high preference for lipid hydroperoxides and protects cells against membrane
        lipid peroxidation and cell death. It is also required for normal sperm development;
        thus, it has been identified as a ''moonlighting'' protein because of its
        ability to serve dual functions as a peroxidase, as well as a structural protein
        in mature spermatozoa. Mutations in ...


        ABCC1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of
        ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules
        across extra-and intra-cellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven
        distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). This full
        transporter is a member of the MRP subfamily which is involved in multi-drug
        resistance. This protei...
