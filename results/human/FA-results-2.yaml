        Here are the gene summaries:



        FANCC: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group C. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FANCD2: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,

        in its localization to nuclear foci with other proteins (BRCA1 AND BRCA2)
        involved in homology-directed DNA repair. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        FANCA: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,

        different isoforms. Mutations in this gene are the most common cause of Fanconi
        anemia. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FANCB: This gene encodes a member of the Fanconi anemia complementation group
        B. This protein is assembled into a nucleoprotein complex that is involved
        in the repair of DNA lesions. Mutations in this gene can cause chromosome
        instability and VACTERL syndrome with hydrocephalus. [provided by RefSeq,

        group E. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FANCF: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).

        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group F. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        BRCA2: Inherited mutations in BRCA1 and this gene, BRCA2, confer increased
        lifetime risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2
        are involved in maintenance of genome stability, specifically the homologous
        recombination pathway for double-strand DNA repair. The largest exon in both
        genes is exon 11, which harbors the most important and frequent mutations
        in breast cancer patients. The BRCA2 gene was found on chromosome 13q12.3
        in human. The BRCA2 protein contains several copies of a 70 aa motif called
        the BRC motif, and these motifs mediate binding to the RAD51 recombinase which
        functions in DNA repair. BRCA2 is considered a tumor suppressor gene, as tumors
        with BRCA2 mutations generally exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the
        wild-type allele. [provided by RefSeq, May 2020]


        FANCI: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group I. Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        BRIP1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the RecQ DEAH helicase
        family and interacts with the BRCT repeats of breast cancer, type 1 (BRCA1).
        The bound complex is important in the normal double-strand break repair function
        of breast cancer, type 1 (BRCA1). This gene may be a target of germline cancer-inducing
        mutations. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PALB2: This gene encodes a protein that may function in tumor suppression.
        This protein binds to and colocalizes with the breast cancer 2 early onset
        protein (BRCA2) in nuclear foci and likely permits the stable intranuclear
        localization and accumulation of BRCA2. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        RAD51C: This gene is a member of the RAD51 family. RAD51 family members are
        highly similar to bacterial RecA and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 and are
        known to be involved in the homologous recombination and repair of DNA. This
        protein can interact with other RAD51 paralogs and is reported to be important
        for Holliday junction resolution. Mutations in this gene are associated with
        Fanconi anemia-like syndrome. This gene is one of four localized to a region
        of chromosome 17q23 where amplification occurs frequently in breast tumors.
        Overexpression of the four genes during amplification has been observed and
        suggests a possible role in tumor progression. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]


        SLX4: This gene encodes a protein that functions as an assembly component
        of multiple structure-specific endonucleases. These endonuclease complexes
        are required for repair of specific types of DNA lesions and critical for
        cellular responses to replication fork failure. Mutations in this gene were
        found in patients with Fanconi anemia. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2016]


        FANCG: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group G. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FANCL: This gene encodes a ubiquitin ligase that is a member of the Fanconi
        anemia complementation group (FANC). Members of this group are related by
        their assembly into a common nuclear protein complex rather than by sequence
        similarity. This gene encodes the protein for complementation group L that
        mediates monoubiquitination of FANCD2 as well as FANCI. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2018]


        ERCC4: The protein encoded by this gene forms a complex with ERCC1 and is
        involved in the 5'' incision made during nucleotide excision repair. This
        complex is a structure specific DNA repair endonuclease that interacts with
        EME1. Defects in this gene are a cause of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation
        group F (XP-F), or xeroderma pigmentosum VI (XP6).[provided by RefSeq, Mar
        2009]


        UBE2T: The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the covalent attachment
        of ubiquitin to protein substrates. Defects in this gene have been associated
        with Fanconi anemia of complementation group T. Two transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul
        2015]


        MAD2L2: The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the mitotic spindle
        assembly checkpoint that prevents the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes
        are properly aligned at the metaphase plate. The encoded protein, which is
        similar to MAD2L1, is capable of interacting with ADAM9, ADAM15, REV1, and
        REV3 proteins. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        RAD51: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the RAD51 protein family.
        RAD51 family members are highly similar to bacterial RecA and Saccharomyces
        cerevisiae Rad51, and are known to be involved in the homologous recombination
        and repair of DNA. This protein can interact with the ssDNA-binding protein
        RPA and RAD52, and it is thought to play roles in homologous pairing and strand
        transfer of DNA. This protein is also found to interact with BRCA1 and BRCA2,
        which may be important for the cellular response to DNA damage. BRCA2 is shown
        to regulate both the intracellular localization and DNA-binding ability of
        this protein. Loss of these controls following BRCA2 inactivation may be a
        key event leading to genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Aug 2009]


        XRCC2: This gene encodes a member of the RecA/Rad51-related protein family
        that participates in homologous recombination to maintain chromosome stability
        and repair DNA damage. This gene is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand
        breaks by homologous recombination and it functionally complements Chinese
        hamster irs1, a repair-deficient mutant that exhibits hypersensitivity to
        a number of different DNA-damaging agents. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group F. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        BRCA2: Inherited mutations in BRCA1 and this gene, BRCA2, confer increased
        lifetime risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2
        are involved in maintenance of genome stability, specifically the homologous
        recombination pathway for double-strand DNA repair. The largest exon in both
        genes is exon 11, which harbors the most important and frequent mutations
        in breast cancer patients. The BRCA2 gene was found on chromosome 13q12.3
        in human. The BRCA2 protein contains several copies of a 70 aa motif called
        the BRC motif, and these motifs mediate binding to the RAD51 recombinase which
        functions in DNA repair. BRCA2 is considered a tumor suppressor gene, as tumors
        with BRCA2 mutations generally exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the
        wild-type allele. [provided by RefSeq, May 2020]


        FANCI: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group I. Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        BRIP1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the RecQ DEAH helicase
        family and interacts with the BRCT repeats of breast cancer, type 1 (BRCA1).
        The bound complex is important in the normal double-strand break repair function
        of breast cancer, type 1 (BRCA1). This gene may be a target of germline cancer-inducing
        mutations. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PALB2: This gene encodes a protein that may function in tumor suppression.
        This protein binds to and colocalizes with the breast cancer 2 early onset
        protein (BRCA2) in nuclear foci and likely permits the stable intranuclear
        localization and accumulation of BRCA2. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        RAD51C: This gene is a member of the RAD51 family. RAD51 family members are
        highly similar to bacterial RecA and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 and are
        known to be involved in the homologous recombination and repair of DNA. This
        protein can interact with other RAD51 paralogs and is reported to be important
        for Holliday junction resolution. Mutations in this gene are associated with
        Fanconi anemia-like syndrome. This gene is one of four localized to a region
        of chromosome 17q23 where amplification occurs frequently in breast tumors.
        Overexpression of the four genes during amplification has been observed and
        suggests a possible role in tumor progression. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]


        SLX4: This gene encodes a protein that functions as an assembly component
        of multiple structure-specific endonucleases. These endonuclease complexes
        are required for repair of specific types of DNA lesions and critical for
        cellular responses to replication fork failure. Mutations in this gene were
        found in patients with Fanconi anemia. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2016]


        FANCG: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).

        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group G. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FANCL: This gene encodes a ubiquitin ligase that is a member of the Fanconi
        anemia complementation group (FANC). Members of this group are related by
        their assembly into a common nuclear protein complex rather than by sequence
        similarity. This gene encodes the protein for complementation group L that
        mediates monoubiquitination of FANCD2 as well as FANCI. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2018]


        ERCC4: The protein encoded by this gene forms a complex with ERCC1 and is
        involved in the 5'' incision made during nucleotide excision repair. This
        complex is a structure specific DNA repair endonuclease that interacts with
        EME1. Defects in this gene are a cause of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation
        group F (XP-F), or xeroderma pigmentosum VI (XP6).[provided by RefSeq, Mar
        2009]


        UBE2T: The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the covalent attachment
        of ubiquitin to protein substrates. Defects in this gene have been associated
        with Fanconi anemia of complementation group T. Two transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul
        2015]


        MAD2L2: The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the mitotic spindle
        assembly checkpoint that prevents the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes
        are properly aligned at the metaphase plate. The encoded protein, which is
        similar to MAD2L1, is capable of interacting with ADAM9, ADAM15, REV1, and
        REV3 proteins. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        RAD51: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the RAD51 protein family.
        RAD51 family members are highly similar to bacterial RecA and Saccharomyces
        cerevisiae Rad51, and are known to be involved in the homologous recombination
        and repair of DNA. This protein can interact with the ssDNA-binding protein
        RPA and RAD52, and it is thought to play roles in homologous pairing and strand
        transfer of DNA. This protein is also found to interact with BRCA1 and BRCA2,
        which may be important for the cellular response to DNA damage. BRCA2 is shown
        to regulate both the intracellular localization and DNA-binding ability of
        this protein. Loss of these controls following BRCA2 inactivation may be a
        key event leading to genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Aug 2009]


        XRCC2: This gene encodes a member of the RecA/Rad51-related protein family
        that participates in homologous recombination to maintain chromosome stability
        and repair DNA damage. This gene is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand
        breaks by homologous recombination and it functionally complements Chinese
        hamster irs1, a repair-deficient mutant that exhibits hypersensitivity to
        a number of different DNA-damaging agents. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        FANCC: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group C. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FANCD2: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).

        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group D2. This protein is monoubiquinated in response to DNA damage, resulting
        in its localization to nuclear foci with other proteins (BRCA1 AND BRCA2)
        involved in homology-directed DNA repair. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        FANCA: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).

        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group A. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms. Mutations in this gene are the most common cause of Fanconi
        anemia. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FANCB: This gene encodes a member of the Fanconi anemia complementation group
        B. This protein is assembled into a nucleoprotein complex that is involved
        in the repair of DNA lesions. Mutations in this gene can cause chromosome
        instability and VACTERL syndrome with hydrocephalus. [provided by RefSeq,
        Apr 2016]


        FANCE: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes

        group E. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FANCF: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes

        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).

        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group F. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        BRCA2: Inherited mutations in BRCA1 and this gene, BRCA2, confer increased
        lifetime risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2
        are involved in maintenance of genome stability, specifically the homologous
        recombination pathway for double-strand DNA repair. The largest exon in both
        genes is exon 11, which harbors the most important and frequent mutations
        in breast cancer patients. The BRCA2 gene was found on chromosome 13q12.3
        in human. The BRCA2 protein contains several copies of a 70 aa motif called
        the BRC motif, and these motifs mediate binding to the RAD51 recombinase which
        functions in DNA repair. BRCA2 is considered a tumor suppressor gene, as tumors
        with BRCA2 mutations generally exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the
        wild-type allele. [provided by RefSeq, May 2020]


        FANCI: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group I. Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        BRIP1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the RecQ DEAH helicase
        family and interacts with the BRCT repeats of breast cancer, type 1 (BRCA1).
        The bound complex is important in the normal double-strand break repair function
        of breast cancer, type 1 (BRCA1). This gene may be a target of germline cancer-inducing
        mutations. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PALB2: This gene encodes a protein that may function in tumor suppression.
        This protein binds to and colocalizes with the breast cancer 2 early onset
        protein (BRCA2) in nuclear foci and likely permits the stable intranuclear
        localization and accumulation of BRCA2. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        RAD51C: This gene is a member of the RAD51 family. RAD51 family members are
        highly similar to bacterial RecA and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 and are
        known to be involved in the homologous recombination and repair of DNA. This
        protein can interact with other RAD51 paralogs and is reported to be important
        for Holliday junction resolution. Mutations in this gene are associated with
        Fanconi anemia-like syndrome. This gene is one of four localized to a region
        of chromosome 17q23 where amplification occurs frequently in breast tumors.
        Overexpression of the four genes during amplification has been observed and
        suggests a possible role in tumor progression. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]


        SLX4: This gene encodes a protein that functions as an assembly component
        of multiple structure-specific endonucleases. These endonuclease complexes
        are required for repair of specific types of DNA lesions and critical for
        cellular responses to replication fork failure. Mutations in this gene were
        found in patients with Fanconi anemia. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2016]


        FANCG: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group G. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FANCL: This gene encodes a ubiquitin ligase that is a member of the Fanconi
        anemia complementation group (FANC). Members of this group are related by
        their assembly into a common nuclear protein complex rather than by sequence
        similarity. This gene encodes the protein for complementation group L that
        mediates monoubiquitination of FANCD2 as well as FANCI. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2018]


        ERCC4: The protein encoded by this gene forms a complex with ERCC1 and is
        involved in the 5'' incision made during nucleotide excision repair. This
        complex is a structure specific DNA repair endonuclease that interacts with
        EME1. Defects in this gene are a cause of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation
        group F (XP-F), or xeroderma pigmentosum VI (XP6).[provided by RefSeq, Mar
        2009]


        UBE2T: The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the covalent attachment
        of ubiquitin to protein substrates. Defects in this gene have been associated
        with Fanconi anemia of complementation group T. Two transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul
        2015]


        MAD2L2: The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the mitotic spindle
        assembly checkpoint that prevents the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes
        are properly aligned at the metaphase plate. The encoded protein, which is
        similar to MAD2L1, is capable of interacting with ADAM9, ADAM15, REV1, and
        REV3 proteins. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        RAD51: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the RAD51 protein family.
        RAD51 family members are highly similar to bacterial RecA and Saccharomyces
        cerevisiae Rad51, and are known to be involved in the homologous recombination
        and repair of DNA. This protein can interact with the ssDNA-binding protein
        RPA and RAD52, and it is thought to play roles in homologous pairing and strand
        transfer of DNA. This protein is also found to interact with BRCA1 and BRCA2,
        which may be important for the cellular response to DNA damage. BRCA2 is shown
        to regulate both the intracellular localization and DNA-binding ability of
        this protein. Loss of these controls following BRCA2 inactivation may be a
        key event leading to genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Aug 2009]


        XRCC2: This gene encodes a member of the RecA/Rad51-related protein family
        that participates in homologous recombination to maintain chromosome stability
        and repair DNA damage. This gene is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand
        breaks by homologous recombination and it functionally complements Chinese
        hamster irs1, a repair-deficient mutant that exhibits hypersensitivity to
        a number of different DNA-damaging agents. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly

        group C. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FANCD2: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes

        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group D2. This protein is monoubiquinated in response to DNA damage, resulting
        in its localization to nuclear foci with other proteins (BRCA1 AND BRCA2)
        involved in homology-directed DNA repair. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        FANCA: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,

        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group A. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms. Mutations in this gene are the most common cause of Fanconi
        anemia. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FANCB: This gene encodes a member of the Fanconi anemia complementation group
        B. This protein is assembled into a nucleoprotein complex that is involved
        in the repair of DNA lesions. Mutations in this gene can cause chromosome
        instability and VACTERL syndrome with hydrocephalus. [provided by RefSeq,

        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group F. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        BRCA2: Inherited mutations in BRCA1 and this gene, BRCA2, confer increased
        lifetime risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2
        are involved in maintenance of genome stability, specifically the homologous
        recombination pathway for double-strand DNA repair. The largest exon in both
        genes is exon 11, which harbors the most important and frequent mutations
        in breast cancer patients. The BRCA2 gene was found on chromosome 13q12.3
        in human. The BRCA2 protein contains several copies of a 70 aa motif called
        the BRC motif, and these motifs mediate binding to the RAD51 recombinase which
        functions in DNA repair. BRCA2 is considered a tumor suppressor gene, as tumors
        with BRCA2 mutations generally exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the
        wild-type allele. [provided by RefSeq, May 2020]


        FANCI: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal

        group I. Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        BRIP1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the RecQ DEAH helicase
        family and interacts with the BRCT repeats of breast cancer, type 1 (BRCA1).
        The bound complex is important in the normal double-strand break repair function
        of breast cancer, type 1 (BRCA1). This gene may be a target of germline cancer-inducing
        mutations. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PALB2: This gene encodes a protein that may function in tumor suppression.
        This protein binds to and colocalizes with the breast cancer 2 early onset
        protein (BRCA2) in nuclear foci and likely permits the stable intranuclear
        localization and accumulation of BRCA2. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        RAD51C: This gene is a member of the RAD51 family. RAD51 family members are
        highly similar to bacterial RecA and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 and are
        known to be involved in the homologous recombination and repair of DNA. This
        protein can interact with other RAD51 paralogs and is reported to be important
        for Holliday junction resolution. Mutations in this gene are associated with
        Fanconi anemia-like syndrome. This gene is one of four localized to a region
        of chromosome 17q23 where amplification occurs frequently in breast tumors.
        Overexpression of the four genes during amplification has been observed and
        suggests a possible role in tumor progression. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]


        SLX4: This gene encodes a protein that functions as an assembly component
        of multiple structure-specific endonucleases. These endonuclease complexes
        are required for repair of specific types of DNA lesions and critical for
        cellular responses to replication fork failure. Mutations in this gene were
        found in patients with Fanconi anemia. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2016]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        FANCL: This gene encodes a ubiquitin ligase that is a member of the Fanconi
        anemia complementation group (FANC). Members of this group are related by
        their assembly into a common nuclear protein complex rather than by sequence
        similarity. This gene encodes the protein for complementation group L that
        mediates monoubiquitination of FANCD2 as well as FANCI. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2018]


        RAD51C: This gene is a member of the RAD51 family. RAD51 family members are
        highly similar to bacterial RecA and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 and are
        known to be involved in the homologous recombination and repair of DNA. This
        protein can interact with other RAD51 paralogs and is reported to be important
        for Holliday junction resolution. Mutations in this gene are associated with
        Fanconi anemia-like syndrome. This gene is one of four localized to a region
        of chromosome 17q23 where amplification occurs frequently in breast tumors.
        Overexpression of the four genes during amplification has been observed and
        suggests a possible role in tumor progression. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]


        FANCE: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group E. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        MAD2L2: The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the mitotic spindle
        assembly checkpoint that prevents the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes
        are properly aligned at the metaphase plate. The encoded protein, which is
        similar to MAD2L1, is capable of interacting with ADAM9, ADAM15, REV1, and
        REV3 proteins. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ERCC4: The protein encoded by this gene forms a complex with ERCC1 and is
        involved in the 5'' incision made during nucleotide excision repair. This
        complex is a structure specific DNA repair endonuclease that interacts with
        EME1. Defects in this gene are a cause of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation
        group F (XP-F), or xeroderma pigmentosum VI (XP6).[provided by RefSeq, Mar
        2009]


        FANCA: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group A. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms. Mutations in this gene are the most common cause of Fanconi
        anemia. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        BRCA2: Inherited mutations in BRCA1 and this gene, BRCA2, confer increased
        lifetime risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2
        are involved in maintenance of genome stability, specifically the homologous
        recombination pathway for double-strand DNA repair. The largest exon in both
        genes is exon 11, which harbors the most important and frequent mutations
        in breast cancer patients. The BRCA2 gene was found on chromosome 13q12.3
        in human. The BRCA2 protein contains several copies of a 70 aa motif called
        the BRC motif, and these motifs mediate binding to the RAD51 recombinase which
        functions in DNA repair. BRCA2 is considered a tumor suppressor gene, as tumors
        with BRCA2 mutations generally exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the
        wild-type allele. [provided by RefSeq, May 2020]


        FANCF: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal

        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group F. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        XRCC2: This gene encodes a member of the RecA/Rad51-related protein family
        that participates in homologous recombination to maintain chromosome stability
        and repair DNA damage. This gene is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand
        breaks by homologous recombination and it functionally complements Chinese
        hamster irs1, a repair-deficient mutant that exhibits hypersensitivity to
        a number of different DNA-damaging agents. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        BRIP1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the RecQ DEAH helicase
        family and interacts with the BRCT repeats of breast cancer, type 1 (BRCA1).
        The bound complex is important in the normal double-strand break repair function
        of breast cancer, type 1 (BRCA1). This gene may be a target of germline cancer-inducing
        mutations. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FANCD2: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,

        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group D2. This protein is monoubiquinated in response to DNA damage, resulting
        in its localization to nuclear foci with other proteins (BRCA1 AND BRCA2)
        involved in homology-directed DNA repair. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        SLX4: This gene encodes a protein that functions as an assembly component
        of multiple structure-specific endonucleases. These endonuclease complexes
        are required for repair of specific types of DNA lesions and critical for
        cellular responses to replication fork failure. Mutations in this gene were
        found in patients with Fanconi anemia. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2016]


        FANCB: This gene encodes a member of the Fanconi anemia complementation group
        B. This protein is assembled into a nucleoprotein complex that is involved
        in the repair of DNA lesions. Mutations in this gene can cause chromosome
        instability and VACTERL syndrome with hydrocephalus. [provided by RefSeq,

        group G. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        UBE2T: The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the covalent attachment
        of ubiquitin to protein substrates. Defects in this gene have been associated
        with Fanconi anemia of complementation group T. Two transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul
        2015]


        RAD51: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the RAD51 protein family.
        RAD51 family members are highly similar to bacterial RecA and Saccharomyces
        cerevisiae Rad51, and are known to be involved in the homologous recombination
        and repair of DNA. This protein can interact with the ssDNA-binding protein
        RPA and RAD52, and it is thought to play roles in homologous pairing and strand
        transfer of DNA. This protein is also found to interact with BRCA1 and BRCA2,
        which may be important for the cellular response to DNA damage. BRCA2 is shown
        to regulate both the intracellular localization and DNA-binding ability of
        this protein. Loss of these controls following BRCA2 inactivation may be a
        key event leading to genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Aug 2009]


        PALB2: This gene encodes a protein that may function in tumor suppression.
        This protein binds to and colocalizes with the breast cancer 2 early onset
        protein (BRCA2) in nuclear foci and likely permits the stable intranuclear
        localization and accumulation of BRCA2. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FANCC: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,

        Here are the gene summaries:



        FANCL: This gene encodes a ubiquitin ligase that is a member of the Fanconi
        anemia complementation group (FANC). Members of this group are related by
        their assembly into a common nuclear protein complex rather than by sequence
        similarity. This gene encodes the protein for complementation group L that
        mediates monoubiquitination of FANCD2 as well as FANCI. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2018]


        RAD51C: This gene is a member of the RAD51 family. RAD51 family members are
        highly similar to bacterial RecA and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 and are
        known to be involved in the homologous recombination and repair of DNA. This
        protein can interact with other RAD51 paralogs and is reported to be important
        for Holliday junction resolution. Mutations in this gene are associated with
        Fanconi anemia-like syndrome. This gene is one of four localized to a region
        of chromosome 17q23 where amplification occurs frequently in breast tumors.
        Overexpression of the four genes during amplification has been observed and
        suggests a possible role in tumor progression. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]

        group E. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        MAD2L2: The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the mitotic spindle
        assembly checkpoint that prevents the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes
        are properly aligned at the metaphase plate. The encoded protein, which is
        similar to MAD2L1, is capable of interacting with ADAM9, ADAM15, REV1, and
        REV3 proteins. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ERCC4: The protein encoded by this gene forms a complex with ERCC1 and is
        involved in the 5'' incision made during nucleotide excision repair. This
        complex is a structure specific DNA repair endonuclease that interacts with
        EME1. Defects in this gene are a cause of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation
        group F (XP-F), or xeroderma pigmentosum VI (XP6).[provided by RefSeq, Mar

        BRCA2: Inherited mutations in BRCA1 and this gene, BRCA2, confer increased
        lifetime risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2
        are involved in maintenance of genome stability, specifically the homologous
        recombination pathway for double-strand DNA repair. The largest exon in both
        genes is exon 11, which harbors the most important and frequent mutations

        Here are the gene summaries:



        FANCL: This gene encodes a ubiquitin ligase that is a member of the Fanconi
        anemia complementation group (FANC). Members of this group are related by
        their assembly into a common nuclear protein complex rather than by sequence
        similarity. This gene encodes the protein for complementation group L that
        mediates monoubiquitination of FANCD2 as well as FANCI. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2018]


        RAD51C: This gene is a member of the RAD51 family. RAD51 family members are
        highly similar to bacterial RecA and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 and are
        known to be involved in the homologous recombination and repair of DNA. This
        protein can interact with other RAD51 paralogs and is reported to be important
        for Holliday junction resolution. Mutations in this gene are associated with
        Fanconi anemia-like syndrome. This gene is one of four localized to a region
        of chromosome 17q23 where amplification occurs frequently in breast tumors.
        Overexpression of the four genes during amplification has been observed and
        suggests a possible role in tumor progression. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]


        FANCE: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group E. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        MAD2L2: The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the mitotic spindle
        assembly checkpoint that prevents the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes
        are properly aligned at the metaphase plate. The encoded protein, which is
        similar to MAD2L1, is capable of interacting with ADAM9, ADAM15, REV1, and
        REV3 proteins. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ERCC4: The protein encoded by this gene forms a complex with ERCC1 and is
        involved in the 5'' incision made during nucleotide excision repair. This
        complex is a structure specific DNA repair endonuclease that interacts with
        EME1. Defects in this gene are a cause of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation
        group F (XP-F), or xeroderma pigmentosum VI (XP6).[provided by RefSeq, Mar
        2009]


        FANCA: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group A. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms. Mutations in this gene are the most common cause of Fanconi
        anemia. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        BRCA2: Inherited mutations in BRCA1 and this gene, BRCA2, confer increased
        lifetime risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2
        are involved in maintenance of genome stability, specifically the homologous
        recombination pathway for double-strand DNA repair. The largest exon in both
        genes is exon 11, which harbors the most important and frequent mutations
        in breast cancer patients. The BRCA2 gene was found on chromosome 13q12.3
        in human. The BRCA2 protein contains several copies of a 70 aa motif called
        the BRC motif, and these motifs mediate binding to the RAD51 recombinase which
        functions in DNA repair. BRCA2 is considered a tumor suppressor gene, as tumors
        with BRCA2 mutations generally exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the
        wild-type allele. [provided by RefSeq, May 2020]


        FANCF: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group F. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        XRCC2: This gene encodes a member of the RecA/Rad51-related protein family
        that participates in homologous recombination to maintain chromosome stability
        and repair DNA damage. This gene is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand
        breaks by homologous recombination and it functionally complements Chinese
        hamster irs1, a repair-deficient mutant that exhibits hypersensitivity to
        a number of different DNA-damaging agents. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        BRIP1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the RecQ DEAH helicase
        family and interacts with the BRCT repeats of breast cancer, type 1 (BRCA1).
        The bound complex is important in the normal double-strand break repair function
        of breast cancer, type 1 (BRCA1). This gene may be a target of germline cancer-inducing
        mutations. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FANCD2: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group D2. This protein is monoubiquinated in response to DNA damage, resulting
        in its localization to nuclear foci with other proteins (BRCA1 AND BRCA2)
        involved in homology-directed DNA repair. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        SLX4: This gene encodes a protein that functions as an assembly component
        of multiple structure-specific endonucleases. These endonuclease complexes
        are required for repair of specific types of DNA lesions and critical for
        cellular responses to replication fork failure. Mutations in this gene were
        found in patients with Fanconi anemia. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2016]


        FANCB: This gene encodes a member of the Fanconi anemia complementation group
        B. This protein is assembled into a nucleoprotein complex that is involved
        in the repair of DNA lesions. Mutations in this gene can cause chromosome
        instability and VACTERL syndrome with hydrocephalus. [provided by RefSeq,
        Apr 2016]


        FANCG: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group G. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        UBE2T: The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the covalent attachment
        of ubiquitin to protein substrates. Defects in this gene have been associated
        with Fanconi anemia of complementation group T. Two transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul
        2015]


        RAD51: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the RAD51 protein family.
        RAD51 family members are highly similar to bacterial RecA and Saccharomyces
        cerevisiae Rad51, and are known to be involved in the homologous recombination
        and repair of DNA. This protein can interact with the ssDNA-binding protein
        RPA and RAD52, and it is thought to play roles in homologous pairing and strand
        transfer of DNA. This protein is also found to interact with BRCA1 and BRCA2,
        which may be important for the cellular response to DNA damage. BRCA2 is shown
        to regulate both the intracellular localization and DNA-binding ability of
        this protein. Loss of these controls following BRCA2 inactivation may be a
        key event leading to genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Aug 2009]


        PALB2: This gene encodes a protein that may function in tumor suppression.
        This protein binds to and colocalizes with the breast cancer 2 early onset
        protein (BRCA2) in nuclear foci and likely permits the stable intranuclear
        localization and accumulation of BRCA2. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FANCC: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation

        transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2018]


        RAD51C: This gene is a member of the RAD51 family. RAD51 family members are
        highly similar to bacterial RecA and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 and are
        known to be involved in the homologous recombination and repair of DNA. This
        protein can interact with other RAD51 paralogs and is reported to be important
        for Holliday junction resolution. Mutations in this gene are associated with
        Fanconi anemia-like syndrome. This gene is one of four localized to a region
        of chromosome 17q23 where amplification occurs frequently in breast tumors.
        Overexpression of the four genes during amplification has been observed and
        suggests a possible role in tumor progression. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]


        FANCE: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group E. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        MAD2L2: The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the mitotic spindle
        assembly checkpoint that prevents the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes
        are properly aligned at the metaphase plate. The encoded protein, which is
        similar to MAD2L1, is capable of interacting with ADAM9, ADAM15, REV1, and
        REV3 proteins. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ERCC4: The protein encoded by this gene forms a complex with ERCC1 and is
        involved in the 5'' incision made during nucleotide excision repair. This
        complex is a structure specific DNA repair endonuclease that interacts with
        EME1. Defects in this gene are a cause of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation
        group F (XP-F), or xeroderma pigmentosum VI (XP6).[provided by RefSeq, Mar
        2009]


        FANCA: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group A. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms. Mutations in this gene are the most common cause of Fanconi
        anemia. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        BRCA2: Inherited mutations in BRCA1 and this gene, BRCA2, confer increased
        lifetime risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2
        are involved in maintenance of genome stability, specifically the homologous
        recombination pathway for double-strand DNA repair. The largest exon in both
        genes is exon 11, which harbors the most important and frequent mutations
        in breast cancer patients. The BRCA2 gene was found on chromosome 13q12.3
        in human. The BRCA2 protein contains several copies of a 70 aa motif called
        the BRC motif, and these motifs mediate binding to the RAD51 recombinase which
        functions in DNA repair. BRCA2 is considered a tumor suppressor gene, as tumors
        with BRCA2 mutations generally exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the
        wild-type allele. [provided by RefSeq, May 2020]


        FANCF: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group F. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        XRCC2: This gene encodes a member of the RecA/Rad51-related protein family
        that participates in homologous recombination to maintain chromosome stability
        and repair DNA damage. This gene is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand
        breaks by homologous recombination and it functionally complements Chinese
        hamster irs1, a repair-deficient mutant that exhibits hypersensitivity to
        a number of different DNA-damaging agents. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        BRIP1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the RecQ DEAH helicase
        family and interacts with the BRCT repeats of breast cancer, type 1 (BRCA1).
        The bound complex is important in the normal double-strand break repair function
        of breast cancer, type 1 (BRCA1). This gene may be a target of germline cancer-inducing
        mutations. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FANCD2: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group D2. This protein is monoubiquinated in response to DNA damage, resulting
        in its localization to nuclear foci with other proteins (BRCA1 AND BRCA2)
        involved in homology-directed DNA repair. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        SLX4: This gene encodes a protein that functions as an assembly component
        of multiple structure-specific endonucleases. These endonuclease complexes
        are required for repair of specific types of DNA lesions and critical for
        cellular responses to replication fork failure. Mutations in this gene were
        found in patients with Fanconi anemia. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2016]


        FANCB: This gene encodes a member of the Fanconi anemia complementation group
        B. This protein is assembled into a nucleoprotein complex that is involved
        in the repair of DNA lesions. Mutations in this gene can cause chromosome
        instability and VACTERL syndrome with hydrocephalus. [provided by RefSeq,
        Apr 2016]


        FANCG: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
        a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic
        instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal
        breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation
        group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly
        into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation
        group G. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        UBE2T: The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the covalent attachment
        of ubiquitin to protein substrates. Defects in this gene have been associated
        with Fanconi anemia of complementation group T. Two transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul
        2015]


        RAD51: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the RAD51 protein family.
        RAD51 family members are highly similar to bacterial RecA and Saccharomyces
        cerevisiae Rad51, and are known to be involved in the homologous recombination
        and repair of DNA. This protein can interact with the ssDNA-binding protein
        RPA and RAD52, and it is thought to play roles in homologous pairing and strand
        transfer of DNA. This protein is also found to interact with BRCA1 and BRCA2,
        which may be important for the cellular response to DNA damage. BRCA2 is shown
        to regulate both the intracellular localization and DNA-binding ability of
        this protein. Loss of these controls following BRCA2 inactivation may be a
        key event leading to genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Aug 2009]


        PALB2: This gene encodes a protein that may function in tumor suppression.
        This protein binds to and colocalizes with the breast cancer 2 early onset
        protein (BRCA2) in nuclear foci and likely permits the stable intranuclear
        localization and accumulation of BRCA2. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FANCC: The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes
        FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG,
        FANCI, FANCJ (also called BRIP1), FANCL, FANCM and FANCN (also called PALB2).
        The previously defined group FANCH is the same as FANCA. Fanconi anemia is
