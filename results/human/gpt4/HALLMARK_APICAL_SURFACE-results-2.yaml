        encodes and ADAM family member that cleaves many proteins including TNF-alpha
        and E-cadherin. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants
        encoding different proteins that may undergo similar processing. [provided

        ADIPOR2: The adiponectin receptors, ADIPOR1 (MIM 607945) and ADIPOR2, serve
        as receptors for globular and full-length adiponectin (MIM 605441) and mediate
        increased AMPK (see MIM 602739) and PPAR-alpha (PPARA; MIM 170998) ligand
        activities, as well as fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake by adiponectin
        (Yamauchi et al., 2003 [PubMed 12802337]).[supplied by OMIM, Mar 2008]

        AKAP7: This gene encodes a member of the A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP)
        family, a group of functionally related proteins that bind to a regulatory
        subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and target the enzyme
        to specific subcellular compartments. AKAPs have a common RII-binding domain,
        but contain different targeting motifs responsible for directing PKA to distinct
        intracellular locations. Three alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms have been described.[provided by RefSeq, Apr 2011]


        APP: This gene encodes a cell surface receptor and transmembrane precursor
        protein that is cleaved by secretases to form a number of peptides. Some of
        these peptides are secreted and can bind to the acetyltransferase complex
        APBB1/TIP60 to promote transcriptional activation, while others form the protein
        basis of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer
        disease. In addition, two of the peptides are antimicrobial peptides, having
        been shown to have bacteriocidal and antifungal activities. Mutations in this
        gene have been implicated in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease and cerebroarterial
        amyloidosis (cerebral amyloid angiopathy). Multiple transcript variants encoding
        several different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq,

        ATP6V0A4: This gene encodes a component of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit
        enzyme that mediates acidification of intracellular compartments of eukaryotic
        cells. V-ATPase dependent acidification is necessary for such intracellular
        processes as protein sorting, zymogen activation, receptor-mediated endocytosis,
        and synaptic vesicle proton gradient generation. V-ATPase is composed of a
        cytosolic V1 domain and a transmembrane V0 domain. The V1 domain consists
        of three A and three B subunits, two G subunits plus the C, D, E, F, and H
        subunits. The V1 domain contains the ATP catalytic site. The V0 domain consists
        of five different subunits: a, c, c'', c'''', and d. This gene is one of four
        genes in man and mouse that encode different isoforms of the a subunit. Alternatively
        spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been described.
        Mutations in this gene are associated with renal tubular acidosis associated

        ATP8B1: This gene encodes a member of the P-type cation transport ATPase family,
        which belongs to the subfamily of aminophospholipid-transporting ATPases.
        The aminophospholipid translocases transport phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine
        from one side of a bilayer to another. Mutations in this gene may result in
        progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 and in benign recurrent
        intrahepatic cholestasis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        B4GALT1: This gene is one of seven beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT)
        genes. They encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have
        exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose; all transfer
        galactose in a beta1,4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars: GlcNAc, Glc, and
        Xyl. Each beta4GalT has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different
        glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they
        have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to
        the Golgi apparatus and which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane
        anchor. By sequence similarity, the beta4GalTs form four groups: beta4GalT1
        and beta4GalT2, beta4GalT3 and beta4GalT4, beta4GalT5 and beta4GalT6, and
        beta4GalT7. This gene is unique among the beta4GalT genes because it encodes
        an enzyme that participates both in glycoconjugate and lactose biosynthesis.
        For the first activity, the enzyme adds galactose to N-acetylglucosamine residues
        that are either monosaccharides or the nonreducing ends of glycoprotein carbohydrate
        chains. The second activity is restricted to lactating mammary tissues where
        the enzyme forms a heterodimer with alpha-lactalbumin to catalyze UDP-galactose
        + D-glucose <=> UDP + lactose. The two enzymatic forms result from alternate
        transcription initiation sites and post-translational processing. Two transcripts,
        which differ only at the 5'' end, with approximate lengths of 4.1 kb and 3.9
        kb encode the same protein. The longer transcript encodes the type II membrane-bound,
        trans-Golgi resident protein involved in glycoconjugate biosynthesis. The
        shorter transcript encodes a protein which is cleaved to form the soluble
        lactose synthase. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        BRCA1: This gene encodes a 190 kD nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role
        in maintaining genomic stability, and it also acts as a tumor suppressor.
        The BRCA1 gene contains 22 exons spanning about 110 kb of DNA. The encoded
        protein combines with other tumor suppressors, DNA damage sensors, and signal
        transducers to form a large multi-subunit protein complex known as the BRCA1-associated
        genome surveillance complex (BASC). This gene product associates with RNA
        polymerase II, and through the C-terminal domain, also interacts with histone
        deacetylase complexes. This protein thus plays a role in transcription, DNA
        repair of double-stranded breaks, and recombination. Mutations in this gene
        are responsible for approximately 40% of inherited breast cancers and more
        than 80% of inherited breast and ovarian cancers. Alternative splicing plays
        a role in modulating the subcellular localization and physiological function
        of this gene. Many alternatively spliced transcript variants, some of which
        are disease-associated mutations, have been described for this gene, but the
        full-length natures of only some of these variants has been described. A related
        pseudogene, which is also located on chromosome 17, has been identified. [provided

        CD160: CD160 is an 27 kDa glycoprotein which was initially identified with
        the monoclonal antibody BY55. Its expression is tightly associated with peripheral
        blood NK cells and CD8 T lymphocytes with cytolytic effector activity. The
        cDNA sequence of CD160 predicts a cysteine-rich, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored
        protein of 181 amino acids with a single Ig-like domain weakly homologous
        to KIR2DL4 molecule. CD160 is expressed at the cell surface as a tightly disulfide-linked
        multimer. RNA blot analysis revealed CD160 mRNAs of 1.5 and 1.6 kb whose expression
        was highly restricted to circulating NK and T cells, spleen and small intestine.
        Within NK cells CD160 is expressed by CD56dimCD16+ cells whereas among circulating
        T cells its expression is mainly restricted to TCRgd bearing cells and to
        TCRab+CD8brightCD95+CD56+CD28-CD27-cells. In tissues, CD160 is expressed on
        all intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes. CD160 shows a broad specificity
        for binding to both classical and nonclassical MHC class I molecules. [provided

        CX3CL1: This gene belongs to the CX3C subgroup of chemokines, characterized
        by the number of amino acids located between the conserved cysteine residues.
        This is the only member of the CX3C subgroup, which contains three amino acids
        between cysteine residues, resulting in a Cys-X-X-X-Cys configuration. The
        encoded protein contains an extended mucin-like stalk with a chemokine domain
        on top, and exists in both a membrane-anchored form where it acts as a binding
        molecule, or, in soluble form, as a chemotactic cytokine. The mature form
        of this protein can be cleaved at the cell surface, yielding different soluble
        forms that can interact with the G-protein coupled receptor, C-X3-C motif
        chemokine receptor 1 gene product. This gene plays a role in a wide range
        of diseases, including cancer, vasculitis, neuropathies, atherosclerosis,
        inflammatory diseases, and in human immunodeficiency virus infections. [provided

        EFNA5: Ephrin-A5, a member of the ephrin gene family, prevents axon bundling
        in cocultures of cortical neurons with astrocytes, a model of late stage nervous
        system development and differentiation. The EPH and EPH-related receptors
        comprise the largest subfamily of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and have
        been implicated in mediating developmental events, particularly in the nervous
        system. EPH receptors typically have a single kinase domain and an extracellular
        region containing a Cys-rich domain and 2 fibronectin type III repeats. The
        ephrin ligands and receptors have been named by the Eph Nomenclature Committee
        (1997). Based on their structures and sequence relationships, ephrins are
        divided into the ephrin-A (EFNA) class, which are anchored to the membrane
        by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage, and the ephrin-B (EFNB) class,
        which are transmembrane proteins. The Eph family of receptors are similarly
        divided into 2 groups based on the similarity of their extracellular domain
        sequences and their affinities for binding ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands.

        EPHB4: Ephrin receptors and their ligands, the ephrins, mediate numerous developmental
        processes, particularly in the nervous system. Based on their structures and
        sequence relationships, ephrins are divided into the ephrin-A (EFNA) class,
        which are anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage,
        and the ephrin-B (EFNB) class, which are transmembrane proteins. The Eph family
        of receptors are divided into 2 groups based on the similarity of their extracellular
        domain sequences and their affinities for binding ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands.
        Ephrin receptors make up the largest subgroup of the receptor tyrosine kinase
        (RTK) family. The protein encoded by this gene binds to ephrin-B2 and plays
        an essential role in vascular development. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FLOT2: Caveolae are small domains on the inner cell membrane involved in vesicular

        GAS1: Growth arrest-specific 1 plays a role in growth suppression.  GAS1 blocks

        GATA3: This gene encodes a protein which belongs to the GATA family of transcription
        factors. The protein contains two GATA-type zinc fingers and is an important
        regulator of T-cell development and plays an important role in endothelial
        cell biology. Defects in this gene are the cause of hypoparathyroidism with
        sensorineural deafness and renal dysplasia. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2009]


        GHRL: This gene encodes the ghrelin-obestatin preproprotein that is cleaved
        to yield two peptides, ghrelin and obestatin. Ghrelin is a powerful appetite
        stimulant and plays an important role in energy homeostasis. Its secretion
        is initiated when the stomach is empty, whereupon it binds to the growth hormone
        secretagogue receptor in the hypothalamus which results in the secretion of
        growth hormone (somatotropin). Ghrelin is thought to regulate multiple activities,
        including hunger, reward perception via the mesolimbic pathway, gastric acid
        secretion, gastrointestinal motility, and pancreatic glucose-stimulated insulin
        secretion. It was initially proposed that obestatin plays an opposing role
        to ghrelin by promoting satiety and thus decreasing food intake, but this
        action is still debated. Recent reports suggest multiple metabolic roles for
        obestatin, including regulating adipocyte function and glucose metabolism.
        Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. In addition,
        antisense transcripts for this gene have been identified and may potentially
        regulate ghrelin-obestatin preproprotein expression. [provided by RefSeq,

        GSTM3: Cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of glutathione S-transferase are
        encoded by two distinct supergene families. At present, eight distinct classes
        of the soluble cytoplasmic mammalian glutathione S-transferases have been
        identified: alpha, kappa, mu, omega, pi, sigma, theta and zeta. This gene
        encodes a glutathione S-transferase that belongs to the mu class. The mu class
        of enzymes functions in the detoxification of electrophilic compounds, including
        carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative
        stress, by conjugation with glutathione. The genes encoding the mu class of
        enzymes are organized in a gene cluster on chromosome 1p13.3 and are known
        to be highly polymorphic. These genetic variations can change an individual''s
        susceptibility to carcinogens and toxins as well as affect the toxicity and
        efficacy of certain drugs. Mutations of this class mu gene have been linked
        with a slight increase in a number of cancers, likely due to exposure with
        environmental toxins. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2008]


        HSPB1: This gene encodes a member of the small heat shock protein (HSP20)
        family of proteins. In response to environmental stress, the encoded protein
        translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and functions as a molecular
        chaperone that promotes the correct folding of other proteins. This protein
        plays an important role in the differentiation of a wide variety of cell types.
        Expression of this gene is correlated with poor clinical outcome in multiple
        human cancers, and the encoded protein may promote cancer cell proliferation
        and metastasis, while protecting cancer cells from apoptosis. Mutations in
        this gene have been identified in human patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
        disease and distal hereditary motor neuropathy. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        IL2RB: The interleukin 2 receptor, which is involved in T cell-mediated immune
        responses, is present in 3 forms with respect to ability to bind interleukin
        2. The low affinity form is a monomer of the alpha subunit and is not involved
        in signal transduction. The intermediate affinity form consists of an alpha/beta
        subunit heterodimer, while the high affinity form consists of an alpha/beta/gamma
        subunit heterotrimer. Both the intermediate and high affinity forms of the
        receptor are involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis and transduction of
        mitogenic signals from interleukin 2. The protein encoded by this gene represents
        the beta subunit and is a type I membrane protein. The use of alternative
        promoters results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein.
        The protein is primarily expressed in the hematopoietic system. The use by
        some variants of an alternate promoter in an upstream long terminal repeat
        (LTR) results in placenta-specific expression. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2016]


        IL2RG: The protein encoded by this gene is an important signaling component
        of many interleukin receptors, including those of interleukin -2, -4, -7 and

        MAL: The protein encoded by this gene is a highly hydrophobic integral membrane
        protein belonging to the MAL family of proteolipids. The protein has been
        localized to the endoplasmic reticulum of T-cells and is a candidate linker
        protein in T-cell signal transduction. In addition, this proteolipid is localized
        in compact myelin of cells in the nervous system and has been implicated in
        myelin biogenesis and/or function. The protein plays a role in the formation,
        stabilization and maintenance of glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains.
        Down-regulation of this gene has been associated with a variety of human epithelial
        malignancies. Alternative splicing produces four transcript variants which
        vary from each other by the presence or absence of alternatively spliced exons

        MDGA1: This gene encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell

        the mature protein has six Ig-like domains, a single fibronectin type III
        domain, a MAM domain and a C-terminal GPI-anchoring site. Studies in other
        mammals suggest this protein plays a role in cell adhesion, migration, and

        trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway.
        The encoded protein undergoes an autocatalytic processing event with its prosegment
        in the ER and is constitutively secreted as an inactive protease into the
        extracellular matrix and trans-Golgi network. It is expressed in liver, intestine
        and kidney tissues and escorts specific receptors for lysosomal degradation.
        It plays a role in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. Mutations in this

        isoforms. Other alternatively spliced transcripts have been described, but
        the full length sequences have not been determined. Several of these transcripts
        are predicted to encode truncated products which lack the TM and may be secreted.

        plasminogen activation and localized degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        It binds both the proprotein and mature forms of urokinase plasminogen activator
        and permits the activation of the receptor-bound pro-enzyme by plasmin. The
        protein lacks transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains and may be anchored to
        the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety following
        cleavage of the nascent polypeptide near its carboxy-terminus. However, a
        soluble protein is also produced in some cell types. Alternative splicing

        SLC2A4: This gene is a member of the solute carrier family 2 (facilitated
        glucose transporter) family and encodes a protein that functions as an insulin-regulated
        facilitative glucose transporter. In the absence of insulin, this integral
        membrane protein is sequestered within the cells of muscle and adipose tissue.
        Within minutes of insulin stimulation, the protein moves to the cell surface
        and begins to transport glucose across the cell membrane. Mutations in this
        gene have been associated with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).

        SLC34A3: This gene encodes a member of SLC34A transporter family of proteins,
        and is expressed primarily in the kidney. It is involved in transporting phosphate
        into cells via sodium cotransport in the renal brush border membrane, and
        contributes to the maintenance of inorganic phosphate concentration in the
        kidney. Mutations in this gene are associated with hereditary hypophosphatemic
        rickets with hypercalciuria. Alternatively spliced transcript variants varying
        in the 5'' UTR have been found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Apr 2010]

        to be involved in cell adhesion. Predicted to act upstream of or within several
        processes, including negative regulation of cell proliferation involved in
        contact inhibition; phagolysosome assembly; and positive regulation of extrinsic
        apoptotic signaling pathway in absence of ligand. Part of collagen-containing
        extracellular matrix. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        SULF2: Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) act as coreceptors for numerous
        heparin-binding growth factors and cytokines and are involved in cell signaling.
        Heparan sulfate 6-O-endosulfatases, such as SULF2, selectively remove 6-O-sulfate
        groups from heparan sulfate. This activity modulates the effects of heparan
        sulfate by altering binding sites for signaling molecules (Dai et al., 2005
        [PubMed 16192265]).[supplied by OMIM, Mar 2008]


        THY1: This gene encodes a cell surface glycoprotein and member of the immunoglobulin
        superfamily of proteins. The encoded protein is involved in cell adhesion
        and cell communication in numerous cell types, but particularly in cells of
        the immune and nervous systems. The encoded protein is widely used as a marker
        for hematopoietic stem cells. This gene may function as a tumor suppressor
        in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2015]

        ADAM10: Members of the ADAM family are cell surface proteins with a unique
        structure possessing both potential adhesion and protease domains. This gene
        encodes and ADAM family member that cleaves many proteins including TNF-alpha
        and E-cadherin. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants
        encoding different proteins that may undergo similar processing. [provided

        ADIPOR2: The adiponectin receptors, ADIPOR1 (MIM 607945) and ADIPOR2, serve
        as receptors for globular and full-length adiponectin (MIM 605441) and mediate
        increased AMPK (see MIM 602739) and PPAR-alpha (PPARA; MIM 170998) ligand

        AKAP7: This gene encodes a member of the A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP)
        family, a group of functionally related proteins that bind to a regulatory
        subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and target the enzyme
        to specific subcellular compartments. AKAPs have a common RII-binding domain,
        but contain different targeting motifs responsible for directing PKA to distinct
        intracellular locations. Three alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms have been described.[provided by RefSeq, Apr 2011]


        APP: This gene encodes a cell surface receptor and transmembrane precursor
        protein that is cleaved by secretases to form a number of peptides. Some of
        these peptides are secreted and can bind to the acetyltransferase complex
        APBB1/TIP60 to promote transcriptional activation, while others form the protein
        basis of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer
        disease. In addition, two of the peptides are antimicrobial peptides, having
        been shown to have bacteriocidal and antifungal activities. Mutations in this
        gene have been implicated in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease and cerebroarterial
        amyloidosis (cerebral amyloid angiopathy). Multiple transcript variants encoding
        several different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq,

        ATP6V0A4: This gene encodes a component of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit
        enzyme that mediates acidification of intracellular compartments of eukaryotic
        cells. V-ATPase dependent acidification is necessary for such intracellular
        processes as protein sorting, zymogen activation, receptor-mediated endocytosis,
        and synaptic vesicle proton gradient generation. V-ATPase is composed of a
        cytosolic V1 domain and a transmembrane V0 domain. The V1 domain consists
        of three A and three B subunits, two G subunits plus the C, D, E, F, and H
        subunits. The V1 domain contains the ATP catalytic site. The V0 domain consists
        of five different subunits: a, c, c'', c'''', and d. This gene is one of four
        genes in man and mouse that encode different isoforms of the a subunit. Alternatively
        spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been described.
        Mutations in this gene are associated with renal tubular acidosis associated
        with preserved hearing. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ATP8B1: This gene encodes a member of the P-type cation transport ATPase family,
        which belongs to the subfamily of aminophospholipid-transporting ATPases.
        The aminophospholipid translocases transport phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine
        from one side of a bilayer to another. Mutations in this gene may result in
        progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 and in benign recurrent
        intrahepatic cholestasis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        B4GALT1: This gene is one of seven beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT)
        genes. They encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have
        exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose; all transfer
        galactose in a beta1,4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars: GlcNAc, Glc, and
        Xyl. Each beta4GalT has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different
        glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they
        have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to
        the Golgi apparatus and which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane
        anchor. By sequence similarity, the beta4GalTs form four groups: beta4GalT1
        and beta4GalT2, beta4GalT3 and beta4GalT4, beta4GalT5 and beta4GalT6, and
        beta4GalT7. This gene is unique among the beta4GalT genes because it encodes
        an enzyme that participates both in glycoconjugate and lactose biosynthesis.
        For the first activity, the enzyme adds galactose to N-acetylglucosamine residues
        that are either monosaccharides or the nonreducing ends of glycoprotein carbohydrate
        chains. The second activity is restricted to lactating mammary tissues where
        the enzyme forms a heterodimer with alpha-lactalbumin to catalyze UDP-galactose
        + D-glucose <=> UDP + lactose. The two enzymatic forms result from alternate
        transcription initiation sites and post-translational processing. Two transcripts,
        which differ only at the 5'' end, with approximate lengths of 4.1 kb and 3.9
        kb encode the same protein. The longer transcript encodes the type II membrane-bound,
        trans-Golgi resident protein involved in glycoconjugate biosynthesis. The
        shorter transcript encodes a protein which is cleaved to form the soluble
        lactose synthase. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        BRCA1: This gene encodes a 190 kD nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role
        in maintaining genomic stability, and it also acts as a tumor suppressor.
        The BRCA1 gene contains 22 exons spanning about 110 kb of DNA. The encoded
        protein combines with other tumor suppressors, DNA damage sensors, and signal
        transducers to form a large multi-subunit protein complex known as the BRCA1-associated
        genome surveillance complex (BASC). This gene product associates with RNA
        polymerase II, and through the C-terminal domain, also interacts with histone
        deacetylase complexes. This protein thus plays a role in transcription, DNA
        repair of double-stranded breaks, and recombination. Mutations in this gene
        are responsible for approximately 40% of inherited breast cancers and more
        than 80% of inherited breast and ovarian cancers. Alternative splicing plays
        a role in modulating the subcellular localization and physiological function
        of this gene. Many alternatively spliced transcript variants, some of which
        are disease-associated mutations, have been described for this gene, but the
        full-length natures of only some of these variants has been described. A related
        pseudogene, which is also located on chromosome 17, has been identified. [provided

        CD160: CD160 is an 27 kDa glycoprotein which was initially identified with
        the monoclonal antibody BY55. Its expression is tightly associated with peripheral
        blood NK cells and CD8 T lymphocytes with cytolytic effector activity. The
        cDNA sequence of CD160 predicts a cysteine-rich, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored
        protein of 181 amino acids with a single Ig-like domain weakly homologous
        to KIR2DL4 molecule. CD160 is expressed at the cell surface as a tightly disulfide-linked
        multimer. RNA blot analysis revealed CD160 mRNAs of 1.5 and 1.6 kb whose expression
        was highly restricted to circulating NK and T cells, spleen and small intestine.
        Within NK cells CD160 is expressed by CD56dimCD16+ cells whereas among circulating
        T cells its expression is mainly restricted to TCRgd bearing cells and to
        TCRab+CD8brightCD95+CD56+CD28-CD27-cells. In tissues, CD160 is expressed on
        all intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes. CD160 shows a broad specificity
        for binding to both classical and nonclassical MHC class I molecules. [provided

        CX3CL1: This gene belongs to the CX3C subgroup of chemokines, characterized
        by the number of amino acids located between the conserved cysteine residues.
        This is the only member of the CX3C subgroup, which contains three amino acids
        between cysteine residues, resulting in a Cys-X-X-X-Cys configuration. The
        encoded protein contains an extended mucin-like stalk with a chemokine domain
        on top, and exists in both a membrane-anchored form where it acts as a binding
        molecule, or, in soluble form, as a chemotactic cytokine. The mature form
        of this protein can be cleaved at the cell surface, yielding different soluble
        forms that can interact with the G-protein coupled receptor, C-X3-C motif
        chemokine receptor 1 gene product. This gene plays a role in a wide range
        of diseases, including cancer, vasculitis, neuropathies, atherosclerosis,
        inflammatory diseases, and in human immunodeficiency virus infections. [provided

        EFNA5: Ephrin-A5, a member of the ephrin gene family, prevents axon bundling
        in cocultures of cortical neurons with astrocytes, a model of late stage nervous
        system development and differentiation. The EPH and EPH-related receptors
        comprise the largest subfamily of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and have
        been implicated in mediating developmental events, particularly in the nervous
        system. EPH receptors typically have a single kinase domain and an extracellular
        region containing a Cys-rich domain and 2 fibronectin type III repeats. The
        ephrin ligands and receptors have been named by the Eph Nomenclature Committee
        (1997). Based on their structures and sequence relationships, ephrins are
        divided into the ephrin-A (EFNA) class, which are anchored to the membrane
        by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage, and the ephrin-B (EFNB) class,
        which are transmembrane proteins. The Eph family of receptors are similarly
        divided into 2 groups based on the similarity of their extracellular domain
        sequences and their affinities for binding ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands.

        EPHB4: Ephrin receptors and their ligands, the ephrins, mediate numerous developmental
        processes, particularly in the nervous system. Based on their structures and
        sequence relationships, ephrins are divided into the ephrin-A (EFNA) class,
        which are anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage,
        and the ephrin-B (EFNB) class, which are transmembrane proteins. The Eph family
        of receptors are divided into 2 groups based on the similarity of their extracellular
        domain sequences and their affinities for binding ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands.
        Ephrin receptors make up the largest subgroup of the receptor tyrosine kinase
        (RTK) family. The protein encoded by this gene binds to ephrin-B2 and plays
        an essential role in vascular development. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FLOT2: Caveolae are small domains on the inner cell membrane involved in vesicular
        trafficking and signal transduction. This gene encodes a caveolae-associated,

        GAS1: Growth arrest-specific 1 plays a role in growth suppression.  GAS1 blocks
        entry to S phase and prevents cycling of normal and transformed cells.  Gas1
        is a putative tumor suppressor gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        GATA3: This gene encodes a protein which belongs to the GATA family of transcription
        factors. The protein contains two GATA-type zinc fingers and is an important
        regulator of T-cell development and plays an important role in endothelial
        cell biology. Defects in this gene are the cause of hypoparathyroidism with
        sensorineural deafness and renal dysplasia. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2009]


        GHRL: This gene encodes the ghrelin-obestatin preproprotein that is cleaved
        to yield two peptides, ghrelin and obestatin. Ghrelin is a powerful appetite
        stimulant and plays an important role in energy homeostasis. Its secretion
        is initiated when the stomach is empty, whereupon it binds to the growth hormone
        secretagogue receptor in the hypothalamus which results in the secretion of
        growth hormone (somatotropin). Ghrelin is thought to regulate multiple activities,
        including hunger, reward perception via the mesolimbic pathway, gastric acid
        secretion, gastrointestinal motility, and pancreatic glucose-stimulated insulin
        secretion. It was initially proposed that obestatin plays an opposing role
        to ghrelin by promoting satiety and thus decreasing food intake, but this
        action is still debated. Recent reports suggest multiple metabolic roles for
        obestatin, including regulating adipocyte function and glucose metabolism.
        Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. In addition,
        antisense transcripts for this gene have been identified and may potentially
        regulate ghrelin-obestatin preproprotein expression. [provided by RefSeq,

        GSTM3: Cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of glutathione S-transferase are
        encoded by two distinct supergene families. At present, eight distinct classes
        of the soluble cytoplasmic mammalian glutathione S-transferases have been
        identified: alpha, kappa, mu, omega, pi, sigma, theta and zeta. This gene
        encodes a glutathione S-transferase that belongs to the mu class. The mu class
        of enzymes functions in the detoxification of electrophilic compounds, including
        carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative
        stress, by conjugation with glutathione. The genes encoding the mu class of
        enzymes are organized in a gene cluster on chromosome 1p13.3 and are known
        to be highly polymorphic. These genetic variations can change an individual''s
        susceptibility to carcinogens and toxins as well as affect the toxicity and
        efficacy of certain drugs. Mutations of this class mu gene have been linked
        with a slight increase in a number of cancers, likely due to exposure with
        environmental toxins. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2008]


        HSPB1: This gene encodes a member of the small heat shock protein (HSP20)
        family of proteins. In response to environmental stress, the encoded protein
        translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and functions as a molecular
        chaperone that promotes the correct folding of other proteins. This protein
        plays an important role in the differentiation of a wide variety of cell types.
        Expression of this gene is correlated with poor clinical outcome in multiple
        human cancers, and the encoded protein may promote cancer cell proliferation
        and metastasis, while protecting cancer cells from apoptosis. Mutations in
        this gene have been identified in human patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
        disease and distal hereditary motor neuropathy. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        IL2RB: The interleukin 2 receptor, which is involved in T cell-mediated immune
        responses, is present in 3 forms with respect to ability to bind interleukin
        2. The low affinity form is a monomer of the alpha subunit and is not involved
        in signal transduction. The intermediate affinity form consists of an alpha/beta
        subunit heterodimer, while the high affinity form consists of an alpha/beta/gamma
        subunit heterotrimer. Both the intermediate and high affinity forms of the
        receptor are involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis and transduction of
        mitogenic signals from interleukin 2. The protein encoded by this gene represents
        the beta subunit and is a type I membrane protein. The use of alternative
        promoters results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein.
        The protein is primarily expressed in the hematopoietic system. The use by
        some variants of an alternate promoter in an upstream long terminal repeat
        (LTR) results in placenta-specific expression. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2016]


        IL2RG: The protein encoded by this gene is an important signaling component
        of many interleukin receptors, including those of interleukin -2, -4, -7 and
        -21, and is thus referred to as the common gamma chain. Mutations in this
        gene cause X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID), as well as X-linked
        combined immunodeficiency (XCID), a less severe immunodeficiency disorder.

        MAL: The protein encoded by this gene is a highly hydrophobic integral membrane
        protein belonging to the MAL family of proteolipids. The protein has been
        localized to the endoplasmic reticulum of T-cells and is a candidate linker
        protein in T-cell signal transduction. In addition, this proteolipid is localized
        in compact myelin of cells in the nervous system and has been implicated in
        myelin biogenesis and/or function. The protein plays a role in the formation,
        stabilization and maintenance of glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains.
        Down-regulation of this gene has been associated with a variety of human epithelial
        malignancies. Alternative splicing produces four transcript variants which
        vary from each other by the presence or absence of alternatively spliced exons
        2 and 3. [provided by RefSeq, May 2012]


        MDGA1: This gene encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell
        surface glycoprotein that is expressed predominantly in the developing nervous
        system. In addition to possessing several cell adhesion molecule-like domains,
        the mature protein has six Ig-like domains, a single fibronectin type III
        domain, a MAM domain and a C-terminal GPI-anchoring site. Studies in other
        mammals suggest this protein plays a role in cell adhesion, migration, and
        axon guidance and, in the developing brain, neuronal migration. In humans,

        NCOA6: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional coactivator that
        can interact with nuclear hormone receptors to enhance their transcriptional
        activator functions. This protein has been shown to be involved in the hormone-dependent
        coactivation of several receptors, including prostanoid, retinoid, vitamin
        D3, thyroid hormone, and steroid receptors. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jun 2011]


        NTNG1: This gene encodes a preproprotein that is processed into a secreted
        protein containing eukaroytic growth factor (EGF)-like domains. This protein
        acts to guide axon growth during neuronal development. Polymorphisms in this
        gene may be associated with schizophrenia. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. [provided by RefSeq,
        Aug 2015]


        PCSK9: This gene encodes a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase
        family, which includes proteases that process protein and peptide precursors
        trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway.
        The encoded protein undergoes an autocatalytic processing event with its prosegment
        in the ER and is constitutively secreted as an inactive protease into the
        extracellular matrix and trans-Golgi network. It is expressed in liver, intestine
        and kidney tissues and escorts specific receptors for lysosomal degradation.
        It plays a role in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. Mutations in this
        gene have been associated with autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia.
        Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by
        RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        PKHD1: The protein encoded by this gene is predicted to have a single transmembrane
        (TM)-spanning domain and multiple copies of an immunoglobulin-like plexin-transcription-factor
        domain. Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms. Other alternatively spliced transcripts have been described, but
        the full length sequences have not been determined. Several of these transcripts
        are predicted to encode truncated products which lack the TM and may be secreted.
        Mutations in this gene cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease,
        also known as polycystic kidney and hepatic disease-1. [provided by RefSeq,
        Jul 2008]


        PLAUR: This gene encodes the receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator
        and, given its role in localizing and promoting plasmin formation, likely
        influences many normal and pathological processes related to cell-surface
        plasminogen activation and localized degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        It binds both the proprotein and mature forms of urokinase plasminogen activator
        and permits the activation of the receptor-bound pro-enzyme by plasmin. The
        protein lacks transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains and may be anchored to
        the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety following
        cleavage of the nascent polypeptide near its carboxy-terminus. However, a
        soluble protein is also produced in some cell types. Alternative splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. The proprotein
        experiences several post-translational cleavage reactions that have not yet
        been fully defined. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        SCUBE1: This gene encodes a cell surface glycoprotein that is a member of
        the SCUBE (signal peptide, CUB domain, EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like
        protein) family. Family members have an amino-terminal signal peptide, nine
        copies of EGF-like repeats and a CUB domain at the carboxyl terminus. This
        protein is expressed in platelets and endothelial cells and may play an important
        role in vascular biology. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2011]


        SHROOM2: This gene represents the human homolog of Xenopus laevis apical protein
        (APX) gene, which is implicated in amiloride-sensitive sodium channel activity.
        It is expressed in endothelial cells and facilitates the formation of a contractile
        network within endothelial cells. Depletion of this gene results in an increase
        in endothelial sprouting, migration, and angiogenesis. This gene is highly
        expressed in the retina, and is a strong candidate for ocular albinism type
        1 syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for
        this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2016]


        SLC22A12: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the organic anion
        transporter (OAT) family, and it acts as a urate transporter to regulate urate
        levels in blood. This protein is an integral membrane protein primarily found
        in epithelial cells of the proximal tubule of the kidney. An elevated level
        of serum urate, hyperuricemia, is associated with increased incidences of
        gout, and mutations in this gene cause renal hypouricemia type 1. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jan
        2013]


        SLC2A4: This gene is a member of the solute carrier family 2 (facilitated
        glucose transporter) family and encodes a protein that functions as an insulin-regulated
        facilitative glucose transporter. In the absence of insulin, this integral
        membrane protein is sequestered within the cells of muscle and adipose tissue.
        Within minutes of insulin stimulation, the protein moves to the cell surface
        and begins to transport glucose across the cell membrane. Mutations in this
        gene have been associated with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).

        SLC34A3: This gene encodes a member of SLC34A transporter family of proteins,
        and is expressed primarily in the kidney. It is involved in transporting phosphate
        into cells via sodium cotransport in the renal brush border membrane, and
        contributes to the maintenance of inorganic phosphate concentration in the
        kidney. Mutations in this gene are associated with hereditary hypophosphatemic
        rickets with hypercalciuria. Alternatively spliced transcript variants varying
        in the 5'' UTR have been found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Apr 2010]

        contact inhibition; phagolysosome assembly; and positive regulation of extrinsic
        apoptotic signaling pathway in absence of ligand. Part of collagen-containing
        extracellular matrix. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        SULF2: Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) act as coreceptors for numerous
        heparin-binding growth factors and cytokines and are involved in cell signaling.
        Heparan sulfate 6-O-endosulfatases, such as SULF2, selectively remove 6-O-sulfate
        groups from heparan sulfate. This activity modulates the effects of heparan
        sulfate by altering binding sites for signaling molecules (Dai et al., 2005
        [PubMed 16192265]).[supplied by OMIM, Mar 2008]

        superfamily of proteins. The encoded protein is involved in cell adhesion
        and cell communication in numerous cell types, but particularly in cells of
        the immune and nervous systems. The encoded protein is widely used as a marker
        for hematopoietic stem cells. This gene may function as a tumor suppressor
        in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2015]

        APBB1/TIP60 to promote transcriptional activation, while others form the protein
        basis of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer
        disease. In addition, two...


        ATP6V0A4: This gene encodes a component of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit
        enzyme that mediates acidification of intracellular compartments of eukaryotic
        cells. V-ATPase dependent acidification is necessary for such intracellular
        processes as protein sorting, zymogen activation, receptor-mediated endocytosis,
        and synaptic vesicle proton gradient generation. V-ATPase is composed of a
        cytosolic V1 domain and a transmembrane V0 domain. The V1 domain consists

        B4GALT1: This gene is one of seven beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT)
        genes. They encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have
        exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose; all transfer
        galactose in a beta1,4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars: GlcNAc, Glc, and
        Xyl. Each beta4GalT has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different
        glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they
        have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to
        the Golgi apparatus and which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane
        anchor. By sequence similarity, the beta4GalTs form four groups: beta4GalT1
        and beta4GalT2, beta4GalT3 and beta4GalT4, beta4GalT5 and beta4GalT6, and
        beta4GalT7. This gene is unique among the beta4GalT genes because it encodes
        an enzyme that participates both in glycoconjugate and lactose...


        BRCA1: This gene encodes a 190 kD nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role
        in maintaining genomic stability, and it also acts as a tumor suppressor.
        The BRCA1 gene contains 22 exons spanning about 110 kb of DNA. The encoded
        protein combines with other tumor suppressors, DNA damage sensors, and signal
        transducers to form a large multi-subunit protein complex known as the BRCA1-associated
        genome surveillance complex (BASC). This gene product associates with RNA
        polymerase II, and through the C-terminal domain, also interacts with histone
        deacetylase complexes. This protein thus plays a role in transcription, DNA
        repair of double-stranded brea...

        encoded protein contains an extended mucin-like stalk with a chemokine domain
        on top, and exists in both a membrane-anchored form where it acts as a binding
        molecule, or, in sol...

        Located in cell surface. Is ...


        EFNA5: Ephrin-A5, a member of the ephrin gene family, prevents axon bundling
        in cocultures of cortical neurons with astrocytes, a model of late stage nervous
        system development and differentiation. The EPH and EPH-related receptors
        comprise the largest subfamily of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and have
        been implicated in mediating developmental events, particularly in the nervous
        system. EPH receptors typically have a single kinase domain and an extracellular
        region containing a Cys-rich domain and 2 fibronectin type III repeats. The
        ephrin ligands and rece...


        EPHB4: Ephrin receptors and their ligands, the ephrins, mediate numerous developmental
        processes, particularly in the nervous system. Based on their structures and
        sequence relationships, ephrins are divided into the ephrin-A (EFNA) class,
        which are anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage,
        and the ephrin-B (EFNB) class, which are transmembrane proteins. The Eph family
        of recepto...

        factors. The protein contains two GATA-type zinc fingers and is an important
        regulator of T-cell development and pla...


        GHRL: This gene encodes the ghrelin-obestatin preproprotein that is cleaved
        to yield two peptides, ghrelin and obestatin. Ghrelin is a powerful appetite
        stimulant and plays an important role in energy homeostasis. Its secretion
        is initiated when the stomach is empty, whereupon it binds to the growth hormone
        secretagogue receptor in the hypothalamus which results in the secretion of
        growth hormone (somatotropin). Ghrelin is thought to regulate multiple activities,
        including hunger, reward perception via the mesolimbic pathway, gastric acid
        secretion, gastrointestinal motility, and pancreatic...


        GSTM3: Cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of glutathione S-transferase are
        encoded by two distinct supergene families. At present, eight distinct classes
        of the soluble cytoplasmic mammalian glutathione S-transferases have been
        identified: alpha, kappa, mu, omega, pi, sigma, theta and zeta. This gene
        encodes a glutathione S-transferase that belongs to the mu class. The mu class
        of enzymes functions in the detoxification of electrophilic compounds, including
        carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative
        stress, by conjugation with glu...


        HSPB1: This gene encodes a member of the small heat shock protein (HSP20)
        family of proteins. In response to environmental stress, the encoded protein
        translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and functions as a molecular
        chaperone that promotes the correct folding of other proteins. This protein
        plays an important role in the differentiation of a wide variety of cell types.

        responses, is present in 3 forms with respect to ability to bind interleukin
        2. The low affinity form is a monomer of the alpha subunit and is not involved
        in signal transduction. The intermediate affinity form consists of an alpha/beta
        subunit heterodimer, while the high affinity form consists of an alpha/beta/gamma
        subunit heterotrimer. Both the intermediate and high affinity forms of the
        receptor are involved in receptor-mediated end...

        to specific subcellular compartments. AKAPs have a ...


        APP: This gene encodes a cell surface receptor and transmembrane precursor
        protein that is cleaved by secretases to form a number of peptides. Some of
        these peptides are secreted and can bind to the acetyltransferase complex
        APBB1/TIP60 to promote transcriptional activation, while others form the protein
        basis of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer
        disease. In addition, two...


        ATP6V0A4: This gene encodes a component of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit
        enzyme that mediates acidification of intracellular compartments of eukaryotic
        cells. V-ATPase dependent acidification is necessary for such intracellular
        processes as protein sorting, zymogen activation, receptor-mediated endocytosis,
        and synaptic vesicle proton gradient generation. V-ATPase is composed of a
        cytosolic V1 domain and a transmembrane V0 domain. The V1 domain consists
        of three A and three B subunits, two G sub...

        B4GALT1: This gene is one of seven beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT)
        genes. They encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have
        exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose; all transfer
        galactose in a beta1,4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars: GlcNAc, Glc, and
        Xyl. Each beta4GalT has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different
        glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they
        have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to
        the Golgi apparatus and which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane
        anchor. By sequence similarity, the beta4GalTs form four groups: beta4GalT1
        and beta4GalT2, beta4GalT3 and beta4GalT4, beta4GalT5 and beta4GalT6, and
        beta4GalT7. This gene is unique among the beta4GalT genes because it encodes
        an enzyme that participates both in glycoconjugate and lactose...


        BRCA1: This gene encodes a 190 kD nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role
        in maintaining genomic stability, and it also acts as a tumor suppressor.
        The BRCA1 gene contains 22 exons spanning about 110 kb of DNA. The encoded
        protein combines with other tumor suppressors, DNA damage sensors, and signal
        transducers to form a large multi-subunit protein complex known as the BRCA1-associated
        genome surveillance complex (BASC). This gene product associates with RNA
        polymerase II, and through the C-terminal domain, also interacts with histone
        deacetylase complexes. This protein thus plays a role in transcription, DNA
        repair of double-stranded brea...


        CD160: CD160 is an 27 kDa glycoprotein which was initially identified with
        the monoclonal antibody BY55. Its expression is tightly associated with peripheral

        between cysteine residues, resulting in a Cys-X-X-X-Cys configuration. The
        encoded protein contains an extended mucin-like stalk with a chemokine domain
        on top, and exists in both a membrane-anchored form where it acts as a binding
        molecule, or, in sol...

        in cocultures of cortical neurons with astrocytes, a model of late stage nervous
        system development and differentiation. The EPH and EPH-related receptors
        comprise the largest subfamily of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and have
        been implicated in mediating developmental events, particularly in the nervous
        system. EPH receptors typically have a single kinase domain and an extracellular
        region containing a Cys-rich domain and 2 fibronectin type III repeats. The
        ephrin ligands and rece...


        EPHB4: Ephrin receptors and their ligands, the ephrins, mediate numerous developmental
        processes, particularly in the nervous system. Based on their structures and
        sequence relationships, ephrins are divided into the ephrin-A (EFNA) class,
        which are anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage,
        and the ephrin-B (EFNB) class, which are transmembrane proteins. The Eph family

        GHRL: This gene encodes the ghrelin-obestatin preproprotein that is cleaved
        to yield two peptides, ghrelin and obestatin. Ghrelin is a powerful appetite
        stimulant and plays an important role in energy homeostasis. Its secretion
        is initiated when the stomach is empty, whereupon it binds to the growth hormone
        secretagogue receptor in the hypothalamus which results in the secretion of
        growth hormone (somatotropin). Ghrelin is thought to regulate multiple activities,
        including hunger, reward perception via the mesolimbic pathway, gastric acid
        secretion, gastrointestinal motility, and pancreatic...


        GSTM3: Cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of glutathione S-transferase are
        encoded by two distinct supergene families. At present, eight distinct classes
        of the soluble cytoplasmic mammalian glutathione S-transferases have been
        identified: alpha, kappa, mu, omega, pi, sigma, theta and zeta. This gene
        encodes a glutathione S-transferase that belongs to the mu class. The mu class
        of enzymes functions in the detoxification of electrophilic compounds, including
        carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative
        stress, by conjugation with glu...


        HSPB1: This gene encodes a member of the small heat shock protein (HSP20)
        family of proteins. In response to environmental stress, the encoded protein
        translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and functions as a molecular
        chaperone that promotes the correct folding of other proteins. This protein
        plays an important role in the differentiation of a wide variety of cell types.

        IL2RB: The interleukin 2 receptor, which is involved in T cell-mediated immune
        responses, is present in 3 forms with respect to ability to bind interleukin
        2. The low affinity form is a monomer of the alpha subunit and is not involved
        in signal transduction. The intermediate affinity form consists of an alpha/beta
        subunit heterodimer, while the high affinity form consists of an alpha/beta/gamma
        subunit heterotrimer. Both the intermediate and high affinity forms of the
        receptor are involved in receptor-mediated end...

        PLAUR: This gene encodes the receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator
        and, given its role in localizing and promoting plasmin formation, likely
        influences many normal and pathological processes related to cell-surface
        plasminogen activation and localized degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        It binds both the proprotein and mature forms of urokinase plasminogen activator
        and permits the activation of the receptor-bound pro-enzyme by plasmin. The

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        to specific subcellular compartments. AKAPs have a ...


        APP: This gene encodes a cell surface receptor and transmembrane precursor
        protein that is cleaved by secretases to form a number of peptides. Some of
        these peptides are secreted and can bind to the acetyltransferase complex
        APBB1/TIP60 to promote transcriptional activation, while others form the protein
        basis of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer
        disease. In addition, two...


        ATP6V0A4: This gene encodes a component of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit
        enzyme that mediates acidification of intracellular compartments of eukaryotic
        cells. V-ATPase dependent acidification is necessary for such intracellular
        processes as protein sorting, zymogen activation, receptor-mediated endocytosis,
        and synaptic vesicle proton gradient generation. V-ATPase is composed of a
        cytosolic V1 domain and a transmembrane V0 domain. The V1 domain consists
        of three A and three B subunits, two G sub...

        B4GALT1: This gene is one of seven beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT)
        genes. They encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have
        exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose; all transfer
        galactose in a beta1,4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars: GlcNAc, Glc, and
        Xyl. Each beta4GalT has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different
        glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they
        have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to
        the Golgi apparatus and which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane
        anchor. By sequence similarity, the beta4GalTs form four groups: beta4GalT1
        and beta4GalT2, beta4GalT3 and beta4GalT4, beta4GalT5 and beta4GalT6, and
        beta4GalT7. This gene is unique among the beta4GalT genes because it encodes
        an enzyme that participates both in glycoconjugate and lactose...


        BRCA1: This gene encodes a 190 kD nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role
        in maintaining genomic stability, and it also acts as a tumor suppressor.
        The BRCA1 gene contains 22 exons spanning about 110 kb of DNA. The encoded
        protein combines with other tumor suppressors, DNA damage sensors, and signal
        transducers to form a large multi-subunit protein complex known as the BRCA1-associated
        genome surveillance complex (BASC). This gene product associates with RNA
        polymerase II, and through the C-terminal domain, also interacts with histone
        deacetylase complexes. This protein thus plays a role in transcription, DNA
        repair of double-stranded brea...


        CD160: CD160 is an 27 kDa glycoprotein which was initially identified with
        the monoclonal antibody BY55. Its expression is tightly associated with peripheral

        cDNA sequence of CD160 predicts a cysteine-rich, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored
        protein of 181 amino acids with a single Ig-like domain weakly homologous
        to KIR2DL4 molecule. CD160 is expressed at the cell surface as a tightly disulfide-linked
        multimer. RNA blot analysis revealed CD160 mRNAs of 1.5 and 1...

        by the number of amino acids located between the conserved cysteine residues.
        This is the only member of the CX3C subgroup, which contains three amino acids
        between cysteine residues, resulting in a Cys-X-X-X-Cys configuration. The
        encoded protein contains an extended mucin-like stalk with a chemokine domain
        on top, and exists in both a membrane-anchored form where it acts as a binding
        molecule, or, in sol...

        Located in cell surface. Is ...


        EFNA5: Ephrin-A5, a member of the ephrin gene family, prevents axon bundling
        in cocultures of cortical neurons with astrocytes, a model of late stage nervous
        system development and differentiation. The EPH and EPH-related receptors
        comprise the largest subfamily of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and have
        been implicated in mediating developmental events, particularly in the nervous
        system. EPH receptors typically have a single kinase domain and an extracellular
        region containing a Cys-rich domain and 2 fibronectin type III repeats. The
        ephrin ligands and rece...


        EPHB4: Ephrin receptors and their ligands, the ephrins, mediate numerous developmental
        processes, particularly in the nervous system. Based on their structures and
        sequence relationships, ephrins are divided into the ephrin-A (EFNA) class,
        which are anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage,
        and the ephrin-B (EFNB) class, which are transmembrane proteins. The Eph family
        of recepto...

        GHRL: This gene encodes the ghrelin-obestatin preproprotein that is cleaved
        to yield two peptides, ghrelin and obestatin. Ghrelin is a powerful appetite
        stimulant and plays an important role in energy homeostasis. Its secretion
        is initiated when the stomach is empty, whereupon it binds to the growth hormone
        secretagogue receptor in the hypothalamus which results in the secretion of
        growth hormone (somatotropin). Ghrelin is thought to regulate multiple activities,
        including hunger, reward perception via the mesolimbic pathway, gastric acid
        secretion, gastrointestinal motility, and pancreatic...


        GSTM3: Cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of glutathione S-transferase are
        encoded by two distinct supergene families. At present, eight distinct classes
        of the soluble cytoplasmic mammalian glutathione S-transferases have been
        identified: alpha, kappa, mu, omega, pi, sigma, theta and zeta. This gene
        encodes a glutathione S-transferase that belongs to the mu class. The mu class
        of enzymes functions in the detoxification of electrophilic compounds, including
        carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative
        stress, by conjugation with glu...


        HSPB1: This gene encodes a member of the small heat shock protein (HSP20)
        family of proteins. In response to environmental stress, the encoded protein
        translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and functions as a molecular
        chaperone that promotes the correct folding of other proteins. This protein
        plays an important role in the differentiation of a wide variety of cell types.

        IL2RB: The interleukin 2 receptor, which is involved in T cell-mediated immune
        responses, is present in 3 forms with respect to ability to bind interleukin
        2. The low affinity form is a monomer of the alpha subunit and is not involved
        in signal transduction. The intermediate affinity form consists of an alpha/beta
        subunit heterodimer, while the high affinity form consists of an alpha/beta/gamma
        subunit heterotrimer. Both the intermediate and high affinity forms of the
        receptor are involved in receptor-mediated end...

        PLAUR: This gene encodes the receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator
        and, given its role in localizing and promoting plasmin formation, likely
        influences many normal and pathological processes related to cell-surface
        plasminogen activation and localized degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        It binds both the proprotein and mature forms of urokinase plasminogen activator

        family, a group of functionally related proteins that bind to a regulatory
        subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and target the enzyme
        to specific subcellular compartments. AKAPs have a ...


        APP: This gene encodes a cell surface receptor and transmembrane precursor
        protein that is cleaved by secretases to form a number of peptides. Some of
        these peptides are secreted and can bind to the acetyltransferase complex
        APBB1/TIP60 to promote transcriptional activation, while others form the protein
        basis of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer
        disease. In addition, two...


        ATP6V0A4: This gene encodes a component of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit
        enzyme that mediates acidification of intracellular compartments of eukaryotic
        cells. V-ATPase dependent acidification is necessary for such intracellular
        processes as protein sorting, zymogen activation, receptor-mediated endocytosis,
        and synaptic vesicle proton gradient generation. V-ATPase is composed of a
        cytosolic V1 domain and a transmembrane V0 domain. The V1 domain consists
        of three A and three B subunits, two G sub...


        ATP8B1: This gene encodes a member of the P-type cation transport ATPase family,
        which belongs to the subfamily of aminophospholipid-transporting ATPases.

        B4GALT1: This gene is one of seven beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT)
        genes. They encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have
        exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose; all transfer
        galactose in a beta1,4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars: GlcNAc, Glc, and
        Xyl. Each beta4GalT has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different
        glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they
        have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to
        the Golgi apparatus and which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane
        anchor. By sequence similarity, the beta4GalTs form four groups: beta4GalT1
        and beta4GalT2, beta4GalT3 and beta4GalT4, beta4GalT5 and beta4GalT6, and
        beta4GalT7. This gene is unique among the beta4GalT genes because it encodes
        an enzyme that participates both in glycoconjugate and lactose...


        BRCA1: This gene encodes a 190 kD nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role
        in maintaining genomic stability, and it also acts as a tumor suppressor.
        The BRCA1 gene contains 22 exons spanning about 110 kb of DNA. The encoded
        protein combines with other tumor suppressors, DNA damage sensors, and signal
        transducers to form a large multi-subunit protein complex known as the BRCA1-associated
        genome surveillance complex (BASC). This gene product associates with RNA
        polymerase II, and through the C-terminal domain, also interacts with histone
        deacetylase complexes. This protein thus plays a role in transcription, DNA
        repair of double-stranded brea...


        CD160: CD160 is an 27 kDa glycoprotein which was initially identified with
        the monoclonal antibody BY55. Its expression is tightly associated with peripheral
        blood NK cells and CD8 T lymphocytes with cytolytic effector activity. The
        cDNA sequence of CD160 predicts a cysteine-rich, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored
        protein of 181 amino acids with a single Ig-like domain weakly homologous
        to KIR2DL4 molecule. CD160 is expressed at the cell surface as a tightly disulfide-linked
        multimer. RNA blot analysis revealed CD160 mRNAs of 1.5 and 1...

        between cysteine residues, resulting in a Cys-X-X-X-Cys configuration. The
        encoded protein contains an extended mucin-like stalk with a chemokine domain
        on top, and exists in both a membrane-anchored form where it acts as a binding
        molecule, or, in sol...

        Located in cell surface. Is ...


        EFNA5: Ephrin-A5, a member of the ephrin gene family, prevents axon bundling
        in cocultures of cortical neurons with astrocytes, a model of late stage nervous
        system development and differentiation. The EPH and EPH-related receptors
        comprise the largest subfamily of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and have
        been implicated in mediating developmental events, particularly in the nervous
        system. EPH receptors typically have a single kinase domain and an extracellular
        region containing a Cys-rich domain and 2 fibronectin type III repeats. The
        ephrin ligands and rece...


        EPHB4: Ephrin receptors and their ligands, the ephrins, mediate numerous developmental
        processes, particularly in the nervous system. Based on their structures and
        sequence relationships, ephrins are divided into the ephrin-A (EFNA) class,
        which are anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage,
        and the ephrin-B (EFNB) class, which are transmembrane proteins. The Eph family
        of recepto...

        entry to S phase and prevents cycling...


        GATA3: This gene encodes a protein which belongs to the GATA family of transcription
        factors. The protein contains two GATA-type zinc fingers and is an important
        regulator of T-cell development and pla...


        GHRL: This gene encodes the ghrelin-obestatin preproprotein that is cleaved
        to yield two peptides, ghrelin and obestatin. Ghrelin is a powerful appetite
        stimulant and plays an important role in energy homeostasis. Its secretion
        is initiated when the stomach is empty, whereupon it binds to the growth hormone
        secretagogue receptor in the hypothalamus which results in the secretion of
        growth hormone (somatotropin). Ghrelin is thought to regulate multiple activities,
        including hunger, reward perception via the mesolimbic pathway, gastric acid
        secretion, gastrointestinal motility, and pancreatic...


        GSTM3: Cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of glutathione S-transferase are
        encoded by two distinct supergene families. At present, eight distinct classes
        of the soluble cytoplasmic mammalian glutathione S-transferases have been
        identified: alpha, kappa, mu, omega, pi, sigma, theta and zeta. This gene
        encodes a glutathione S-transferase that belongs to the mu class. The mu class
        of enzymes functions in the detoxification of electrophilic compounds, including
        carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative
        stress, by conjugation with glu...


        HSPB1: This gene encodes a member of the small heat shock protein (HSP20)
        family of proteins. In response to environmental stress, the encoded protein
        translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and functions as a molecular
        chaperone that promotes the correct folding of other proteins. This protein
        plays an important role in the differentiation of a wide variety of cell types.

        IL2RB: The interleukin 2 receptor, which is involved in T cell-mediated immune
        responses, is present in 3 forms with respect to ability to bind interleukin
        2. The low affinity form is a monomer of the alpha subunit and is not involved
        in signal transduction. The intermediate affinity form consists of an alpha/beta
        subunit heterodimer, while the high affinity form consists of an alpha/beta/gamma
        subunit heterotrimer. Both the intermediate and high affinity forms of the
        receptor are involved in receptor-mediated end...


        IL2RG: The protein encoded by this gene is an important signaling component
        of many interleukin receptors, including those of interleukin -2, -4, -7 and
        -21, and is thus referred to as the common gamma chain. Mutati...

        protein in T-cell signal transduction. In addition, this proteolipid is localized
        in compact myelin of cells in the nervous system and has been implicated in
        myelin biogenesis and/or function. Th...


        MDGA1: This gene encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell
        surface glycoprotein that is expressed predominantly in the developing nervous
        system. In addition to possessing several cell adhesion molecule-like domains,
        the mature protein has six Ig-like domains, a single fibronectin type III
        domain, a MAM do...


        NCOA6: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional coactivator that
        can interact with nuclear hormone receptors to enhance their transcriptional
        activator functions. This protein has been shown to be involved in the hormone-dependent
        coactivation o...


        NTNG1: This gene encodes a preproprotein that is processed into a secreted

        (TM)-spanning domain and multiple copies of an immunoglobulin-like plexin-transcription-factor
        domain. Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms. Other alternatively spliced transcripts have been described, but
        the ...


        PLAUR: This gene encodes the receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator
        and, given its role in localizing and promoting plasmin formation, likely
        influences many normal and pathological processes related to cell-surface
        plasminogen activation and localized degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        It binds both the proprotein and mature forms of urokinase plasminogen activator
        and permits the activation of the receptor-bound pro-enzyme by plasmin. The
        protein lacks transmembrane or cytoplasmi...

        Here are the gene summaries:



        THY1: This gene encodes a cell surface glycoprotein and member of the immunoglobulin
        superfamily of proteins. The encoded protein is involved in cell adhesion
        and cell communication in numerous cell types, but particularly in cells of
        the immune and nervous systems. The encoded protein is widely used as a marker
        for hematopoietic stem cells. This gene may function as a tumor suppressor
        in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2015]

        to be involved in cell adhesion. Predicted to act upstream of or within several
        processes, including negative regulation of cell proliferation involved in

        apoptotic signaling pathway in absence of ligand. Part of collagen-containing
        extracellular matrix. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        RHCG: Enables ammonium transmembrane transporter activity; ankyrin binding
        activity; and identical protein binding activity. Involved in ammonium transmembrane
        transport; cellular ion homeostasis; and transepithelial ammonium transport.
        Located in apical plasma membrane and basolateral plasma membrane. Is integral
        component of plasma membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr
        2022]


        HSPB1: This gene encodes a member of the small heat shock protein (HSP20)
        family of proteins. In response to environmental stress, the encoded protein
        translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and functions as a molecular
        chaperone that promotes the correct folding of other proteins. This protein
        plays an important role in the differentiation of a wide variety of cell types.
        Expression of this gene is correlated with poor clinical outcome in multiple
        human cancers, and the encoded protein may promote cancer cell proliferation
        and metastasis, while protecting cancer cells from apoptosis. Mutations in
        this gene have been identified in human patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
        disease and distal hereditary motor neuropathy. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        NTNG1: This gene encodes a preproprotein that is processed into a secreted
        protein containing eukaroytic growth factor (EGF)-like domains. This protein
        acts to guide axon growth during neuronal development. Polymorphisms in this
        gene may be associated with schizophrenia. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. [provided by RefSeq,
        Aug 2015]


        GAS1: Growth arrest-specific 1 plays a role in growth suppression.  GAS1 blocks
        entry to S phase and prevents cycling of normal and transformed cells.  Gas1
        is a putative tumor suppressor gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        MDGA1: This gene encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell
        surface glycoprotein that is expressed predominantly in the developing nervous
        system. In addition to possessing several cell adhesion molecule-like domains,
        the mature protein has six Ig-like domains, a single fibronectin type III
        domain, a MAM domain and a C-terminal GPI-anchoring site. Studies in other
        mammals suggest this protein plays a role in cell adhesion, migration, and
        axon guidance and, in the developing brain, neuronal migration. In humans,
        this gene is associated with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. [provided
        by RefSeq, Oct 2016]


        SLC22A12: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the organic anion
        transporter (OAT) family, and it acts as a urate transporter to regulate urate
        levels in blood. This protein is an integral membrane protein primarily found
        in epithelial cells of the proximal tubule of the kidney. An elevated level
        of serum urate, hyperuricemia, is associated with increased incidences of
        gout, and mutations in this gene cause renal hypouricemia type 1. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jan
        2013]


        EFNA5: Ephrin-A5, a member of the ephrin gene family, prevents axon bundling
        in cocultures of cortical neurons with astrocytes, a model of late stage nervous
        system development and differentiation. The EPH and EPH-related receptors
        comprise the largest subfamily of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and have
        been implicated in mediating developmental events, particularly in the nervous
        system. EPH receptors typically have a single kinase domain and an extracellular
        region containing a Cys-rich domain and 2 fibronectin type III repeats. The
        ephrin ligands and receptors have been named by the Eph Nomenclature Committee
        (1997). Based on their structures and sequence relationships, ephrins are
        divided into the ephrin-A (EFNA) class, which are anchored to the membrane
        by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage, and the ephrin-B (EFNB) class,
        which are transmembrane proteins. The Eph family of receptors are similarly
        divided into 2 groups based on the similarity of their extracellular domain
        sequences and their affinities for binding ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands.

        BRCA1: This gene encodes a 190 kD nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role
        in maintaining genomic stability, and it also acts as a tumor suppressor.
        The BRCA1 gene contains 22 exons spanning about 110 kb of DNA. The encoded
        protein combines with other tumor suppressors, DNA damage sensors, and signal
        transducers to form a large multi-subunit protein complex known as the BRCA1-associated
        genome surveillance complex (BASC). This gene product associates with RNA
        polymerase II, and through the C-terminal domain, also interacts with histone
        deacetylase complexes. This protein thus plays a role in transcription, DNA
        repair of double-stranded breaks, and recombination. Mutations in this gene
        are responsible for approximately 40% of inherited breast cancers and more
        than 80% of inherited breast and ovarian cancers. Alternative splicing plays
        a role in modulating the subcellular localization and physiological function
        of this gene. Many alternatively spliced transcript variants, some of which
        are disease-associated mutations, have been described for this gene, but the
        full-length natures of only some of these variants has been described. A related
        pseudogene, which is also located on chromosome 17, has been identified. [provided
        by RefSeq, May 2020]


        LYPD3: Predicted to enable laminin binding activity. Predicted to act upstream
        of or within cell-matrix adhesion. Located in extracellular space. [provided
        by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        APP: This gene encodes a cell surface receptor and transmembrane precursor
        protein that is cleaved by secretases to form a number of peptides. Some of
        these peptides are secreted and can bind to the acetyltransferase complex
        APBB1/TIP60 to promote transcriptional activation, while others form the protein
        basis of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer
        disease. In addition, two of the peptides are antimicrobial peptides, having
        been shown to have bacteriocidal and antifungal activities. Mutations in this
        gene have been implicated in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease and cerebroarterial
        amyloidosis (cerebral amyloid angiopathy). Multiple transcript variants encoding
        several different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq,
        Aug 2014]


        LYN: This gene encodes a tyrosine protein kinase, which maybe involved in
        the regulation of mast cell degranulation, and erythroid differentiation.
        Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have
        been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2011]


        GSTM3: Cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of glutathione S-transferase are
        encoded by two distinct supergene families. At present, eight distinct classes
        of the soluble cytoplasmic mammalian glutathione S-transferases have been
        identified: alpha, kappa, mu, omega, pi, sigma, theta and zeta. This gene
        encodes a glutathione S-transferase that belongs to the mu class. The mu class
        of enzymes functions in the detoxification of electrophilic compounds, including
        carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative
        stress, by conjugation with glutathione. The genes encoding the mu class of
        enzymes are organized in a gene cluster on chromosome 1p13.3 and are known
        to be highly polymorphic. These genetic variations can change an individual''s
        susceptibility to carcinogens and toxins as well as affect the toxicity and
        efficacy of certain drugs. Mutations of this class mu gene have been linked
        with a slight increase in a number of cancers, likely due to exposure with
        environmental toxins. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2008]


        PCSK9: This gene encodes a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase
        family, which includes proteases that process protein and peptide precursors
        trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway.
        The encoded protein undergoes an autocatalytic processing event with its prosegment
        in the ER and is constitutively secreted as an inactive protease into the
        extracellular matrix and trans-Golgi network. It is expressed in liver, intestine
        and kidney tissues and escorts specific receptors for lysosomal degradation.
        It plays a role in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. Mutations in this
        gene have been associated with autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia.
        Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by
        RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        MAL: The protein encoded by this gene is a highly hydrophobic integral membrane
        protein belonging to the MAL family of proteolipids. The protein has been
        localized to the endoplasmic reticulum of T-cells and is a candidate linker
        protein in T-cell signal transduction. In addition, this proteolipid is localized
        in compact myelin of cells in the nervous system and has been implicated in
        myelin biogenesis and/or function. The protein plays a role in the formation,
        stabilization and maintenance of glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains.
        Down-regulation of this gene has been associated with a variety of human epithelial
        malignancies. Alternative splicing produces four transcript variants which
        vary from each other by the presence or absence of alternatively spliced exons
        2 and 3. [provided by RefSeq, May 2012]


        AFAP1L2: Enables SH2 domain binding activity; SH3 domain binding activity;

        PKHD1: The protein encoded by this gene is predicted to have a single transmembrane
        (TM)-spanning domain and multiple copies of an immunoglobulin-like plexin-transcription-factor
        domain. Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms. Other alternatively spliced transcripts have been described, but
        the full length sequences have not been determined. Several of these transcripts
        are predicted to encode truncated products which lack the TM and may be secreted.
        Mutations in this gene cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease,
        also known as polycystic kidney and hepatic disease-1. [provided by RefSeq,

        ATP6V0A4: This gene encodes a component of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit
        enzyme that mediates acidification of intracellular compartments of eukaryotic
        cells. V-ATPase dependent acidification is necessary for such intracellular
        processes as protein sorting, zymogen activation, receptor-mediated endocytosis,
        and synaptic vesicle proton gradient generation. V-ATPase is composed of a
        cytosolic V1 domain and a transmembrane V0 domain. The V1 domain consists
        of three A and three B subunits, two G subunits plus the C, D, E, F, and H
        subunits. The V1 domain contains the ATP catalytic site. The V0 domain consists
        of five different subunits: a, c, c'', c'''', and d. This gene is one of four
        genes in man and mouse that encode different isoforms of the a subunit. Alternatively
        spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been described.
        Mutations in this gene are associated with renal tubular acidosis associated
        with preserved hearing. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        NCOA6: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional coactivator that
        can interact with nuclear hormone receptors to enhance their transcriptional
        activator functions. This protein has been shown to be involved in the hormone-dependent
        coactivation of several receptors, including prostanoid, retinoid, vitamin
        D3, thyroid hormone, and steroid receptors. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene. [provided

        FLOT2: Caveolae are small domains on the inner cell membrane involved in vesicular
        trafficking and signal transduction. This gene encodes a caveolae-associated,
        integral membrane protein, which is thought to function in neuronal signaling.

        CROCC: Predicted to enable kinesin binding activity and structural molecule
        activity. Involved in several processes, including centriole-centriole cohesion;
        positive regulation of cilium assembly; and positive regulation of protein
        localization to cilium. Located in cytoskeleton; cytosol; and plasma membrane.

        CD160: CD160 is an 27 kDa glycoprotein which was initially identified with
        the monoclonal antibody BY55. Its expression is tightly associated with peripheral
        blood NK cells and CD8 T lymphocytes with cytolytic effector activity. The
        cDNA sequence of CD160 predicts a cysteine-rich, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored
        protein of 181 amino acids with a single Ig-like domain weakly homologous
        to KIR2DL4 molecule. CD160 is expressed at the cell surface as a tightly disulfide-linked
        multimer. RNA blot analysis revealed CD160 mRNAs of 1.5 and 1.6 kb whose expression
        was highly restricted to circulating NK and T cells, spleen and small intestine.
        Within NK cells CD160 is expressed by CD56dimCD16+ cells whereas among circulating
        T cells its expression is mainly restricted to TCRgd bearing cells and to
        TCRab+CD8brightCD95+CD56+CD28-CD27-cells. In tissues, CD160 is expressed on
        all intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes. CD160 shows a broad specificity
        for binding to both classical and nonclassical MHC class I molecules. [provided

        SLC2A4: This gene is a member of the solute carrier family 2 (facilitated
        glucose transporter) family and encodes a protein that functions as an insulin-regulated
        facilitative glucose transporter. In the absence of insulin, this integral
        membrane protein is sequestered within the cells of muscle and adipose tissue.
        Within minutes of insulin stimulation, the protein moves to the cell surface
        and begins to transport glucose across the cell membrane. Mutations in this
        gene have been associated with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).

        SHROOM2: This gene represents the human homolog of Xenopus laevis apical protein
        (APX) gene, which is implicated in amiloride-sensitive sodium channel activity.
        It is expressed in endothelial cells and facilitates the formation of a contractile
        network within endothelial cells. Depletion of this gene results in an increase
        in endothelial sprouting, migration, and angiogenesis. This gene is highly
        expressed in the retina, and is a strong candidate for ocular albinism type
        1 syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for
        this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2016]


        ADIPOR2: The adiponectin receptors, ADIPOR1 (MIM 607945) and ADIPOR2, serve
        as receptors for globular and full-length adiponectin (MIM 605441) and mediate
        increased AMPK (see MIM 602739) and PPAR-alpha (PPARA; MIM 170998) ligand
        activities, as well as fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake by adiponectin
        (Yamauchi et al., 2003 [PubMed 12802337]).[supplied by OMIM, Mar 2008]


        ADAM10: Members of the ADAM family are cell surface proteins with a unique
        structure possessing both potential adhesion and protease domains. This gene
        encodes and ADAM family member that cleaves many proteins including TNF-alpha
        and E-cadherin. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants
        encoding different proteins that may undergo similar processing. [provided
        by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        EPHB4: Ephrin receptors and their ligands, the ephrins, mediate numerous developmental
        processes, particularly in the nervous system. Based on their structures and
        sequence relationships, ephrins are divided into the ephrin-A (EFNA) class,
        which are anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage,
        and the ephrin-B (EFNB) class, which are transmembrane proteins. The Eph family
        of receptors are divided into 2 groups based on the similarity of their extracellular
        domain sequences and their affinities for binding ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands.
        Ephrin receptors make up the largest subgroup of the receptor tyrosine kinase
        (RTK) family. The protein encoded by this gene binds to ephrin-B2 and plays
        an essential role in vascular development. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        IL2RG: The protein encoded by this gene is an important signaling component
        of many interleukin receptors, including those of interleukin -2, -4, -7 and
        -21, and is thus referred to as the common gamma chain. Mutations in this
        gene cause X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID), as well as X-linked
        combined immunodeficiency (XCID), a less severe immunodeficiency disorder.
        [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2010]


        IL2RB: The interleukin 2 receptor, which is involved in T cell-mediated immune
        responses, is present in 3 forms with respect to ability to bind interleukin
        2. The low affinity form is a monomer of the alpha subunit and is not involved
        in signal transduction. The intermediate affinity form consists of an alpha/beta
        subunit heterodimer, while the high affinity form consists of an alpha/beta/gamma
        subunit heterotrimer. Both the intermediate and high affinity forms of the
        receptor are involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis and transduction of
        mitogenic signals from interleukin 2. The protein encoded by this gene represents
        the beta subunit and is a type I membrane protein. The use of alternative
        promoters results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein.
        The protein is primarily expressed in the hematopoietic system. The use by
        some variants of an alternate promoter in an upstream long terminal repeat
        (LTR) results in placenta-specific expression. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2016]


        SLC34A3: This gene encodes a member of SLC34A transporter family of proteins,
        and is expressed primarily in the kidney. It is involved in transporting phosphate
        into cells via sodium cotransport in the renal brush border membrane, and
        contributes to the maintenance of inorganic phosphate concentration in the
        kidney. Mutations in this gene are associated with hereditary hypophosphatemic
        rickets with hypercalciuria. Alternatively spliced transcript variants varying
        in the 5'' UTR have been found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Apr 2010]


        SCUBE1: This gene encodes a cell surface glycoprotein that is a member of
        the SCUBE (signal peptide, CUB domain, EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like
        protein) family. Family members have an amino-terminal signal peptide, nine
        copies of EGF-like repeats and a CUB domain at the carboxyl terminus. This
        protein is expressed in platelets and endothelial cells and may play an important
        role in vascular biology. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2011]


        PLAUR: This gene encodes the receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator
        and, given its role in localizing and promoting plasmin formation, likely
        influences many normal and pathological processes related to cell-surface
        plasminogen activation and localized degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        It binds both the proprotein and mature forms of urokinase plasminogen activator
        and permits the activation of the receptor-bound pro-enzyme by plasmin. The
        protein lacks transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains and may be anchored to
        the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety following
        cleavage of the nascent polypeptide near its carboxy-terminus. However, a
        soluble protein is also produced in some cell types. Alternative splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. The proprotein
        experiences several post-translational cleavage reactions that have not yet
        been fully defined. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        GATA3: This gene encodes a protein which belongs to the GATA family of transcription
        factors. The protein contains two GATA-type zinc fingers and is an important
        regulator of T-cell development and plays an important role in endothelial
        cell biology. Defects in this gene are the cause of hypoparathyroidism with
        sensorineural deafness and renal dysplasia. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2009]

        SULF2: Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) act as coreceptors for numerous
        heparin-binding growth factors and cytokines and are involved in cell signaling.
        Heparan sulfate 6-O-endosulfatases, such as SULF2, selectively remove 6-O-sulfate
        groups from heparan sulfate. This activity modulates the effects of heparan
        sulfate by altering binding sites for signaling molecules (Dai et al., 2005
        [PubMed 16192265]).[supplied by OMIM, Mar 2008]


        AKAP7: This gene encodes a member of the A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP)
        family, a group of functionally related proteins that bind to a regulatory
        subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and target the enzyme
        to specific subcellular compartments. AKAPs have a common RII-binding domain,
        but contain different targeting motifs responsible for directing PKA to distinct
        intracellular locations. Three alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms have been described.[provided by RefSeq, Apr 2011]


        B4GALT1: This gene is one of seven beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT)
        genes. They encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have
        exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose; all transfer
        galactose in a beta1,4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars: GlcNAc, Glc, and
        Xyl. Each beta4GalT has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different
        glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they
        have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to
        the Golgi apparatus and which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane
        anchor. By sequence similarity, the beta4GalTs form four groups: beta4GalT1
        and beta4GalT2, beta4GalT3 and beta4GalT4, beta4GalT5 and beta4GalT6, and
        beta4GalT7. This gene is unique among the beta4GalT genes because it encodes
        an enzyme that participates both in glycoconjugate and lactose biosynthesis.
        For the first activity, the enzyme adds galactose to N-acetylglucosamine residues
        that are either monosaccharides or the nonreducing ends of glycoprotein carbohydrate
        chains. The second activity is restricted to lactating mammary tissues where
        the enzyme forms a heterodimer with alpha-lactalbumin to catalyze UDP-galactose
        + D-glucose <=> UDP + lactose. The two enzymatic forms result from alternate
        transcription initiation sites and post-translational processing. Two transcripts,
        which differ only at the 5'' end, with approximate lengths of 4.1 kb and 3.9
        kb encode the same protein. The longer transcript encodes the type II membrane-bound,
        trans-Golgi resident protein involved in glycoconjugate biosynthesis. The
        shorter transcript encodes a protein which is cleaved to form the soluble
        lactose synthase. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        THY1: This gene encodes a cell surface glycoprotein and member of the immunoglobulin
        superfamily of proteins. The encoded protein is involved in cell adhesion
        and cell communication in numerous cell types, but particularly in cells of
        the immune and nervous systems. The encoded protein is widely used as a marker
        for hematopoietic stem cells. This gene may function as a tumor suppressor
        in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2015]


        SRPX: Predicted to be an extracellular matrix structural constituent. Predicted
        to be involved in cell adhesion. Predicted to act upstream of or within several
        processes, including negative regulation of cell proliferation involved in
        contact inhibition; phagolysosome assembly; and positive regulation of extrinsic
        apoptotic signaling pathway in absence of ligand. Part of collagen-containing
        extracellular matrix. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        RHCG: Enables ammonium transmembrane transporter activity; ankyrin binding
        activity; and identical protein binding activity. Involved in ammonium transmembrane
        transport; cellular ion homeostasis; and transepithelial ammonium transport.
        Located in apical plasma membrane and basolateral plasma membrane. Is integral
        component of plasma membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr
        2022]


        HSPB1: This gene encodes a member of the small heat shock protein (HSP20)
        family of proteins. In response to environmental stress, the encoded protein
        translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and functions as a molecular
        chaperone that promotes the correct folding of other proteins. This protein
        plays an important role in the differentiation of a wide variety of cell types.
        Expression of this gene is correlated with poor clinical outcome in multiple
        human cancers, and the encoded protein may promote cancer cell proliferation
        and metastasis, while protecting cancer cells from apoptosis. Mutations in
        this gene have been identified in human patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
        disease and distal hereditary motor neuropathy. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        NTNG1: This gene encodes a preproprotein that is processed into a secreted
        protein containing eukaroytic growth factor (EGF)-like domains. This protein
        acts to guide axon growth during neuronal development. Polymorphisms in this
        gene may be associated with schizophrenia. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. [provided by RefSeq,
        Aug 2015]


        GAS1: Growth arrest-specific 1 plays a role in growth suppression.  GAS1 blocks
        entry to S phase and prevents cycling of normal and transformed cells.  Gas1
        is a putative tumor suppressor gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        MDGA1: This gene encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell
        surface glycoprotein that is expressed predominantly in the developing nervous
        system. In addition to possessing several cell adhesion molecule-like domains,
        the mature protein has six Ig-like domains, a single fibronectin type III
        domain, a MAM domain and a C-terminal GPI-anchoring site. Studies in other
        mammals suggest this protein plays a role in cell adhesion, migration, and
        axon guidance and, in the developing brain, neuronal migration. In humans,
        this gene is associated with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. [provided
        by RefSeq, Oct 2016]


        SLC22A12: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the organic anion
        transporter (OAT) family, and it acts as a urate transporter to regulate urate
        levels in blood. This protein is an integral membrane protein primarily found
        in epithelial cells of the proximal tubule of the kidney. An elevated level
        of serum urate, hyperuricemia, is associated with increased incidences of
        gout, and mutations in this gene cause renal hypouricemia type 1. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jan
        2013]


        EFNA5: Ephrin-A5, a member of the ephrin gene family, prevents axon bundling
        in cocultures of cortical neurons with astrocytes, a model of late stage nervous
        system development and differentiation. The EPH and EPH-related receptors
        comprise the largest subfamily of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and have
        been implicated in mediating developmental events, particularly in the nervous
        system. EPH receptors typically have a single kinase domain and an extracellular
        region containing a Cys-rich domain and 2 fibronectin type III repeats. The
        ephrin ligands and receptors have been named by the Eph Nomenclature Committee
        (1997). Based on their structures and sequence relationships, ephrins are
        divided into the ephrin-A (EFNA) class, which are anchored to the membrane
        by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage, and the ephrin-B (EFNB) class,
        which are transmembrane proteins. The Eph family of receptors are similarly
        divided into 2 groups based on the similarity of their extracellular domain
        sequences and their affinities for binding ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands.

        BRCA1: This gene encodes a 190 kD nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role
        in maintaining genomic stability, and it also acts as a tumor suppressor.
        The BRCA1 gene contains 22 exons spanning about 110 kb of DNA. The encoded
        protein combines with other tumor suppressors, DNA damage sensors, and signal
        transducers to form a large multi-subunit protein complex known as the BRCA1-associated
        genome surveillance complex (BASC). This gene product associates with RNA
        polymerase II, and through the C-terminal domain, also interacts with histone
        deacetylase complexes. This protein thus plays a role in transcription, DNA
        repair of double-stranded breaks, and recombination. Mutations in this gene
        are responsible for approximately 40% of inherited breast cancers and more
        than 80% of inherited breast and ovarian cancers. Alternative splicing plays
        a role in modulating the subcellular localization and physiological function
        of this gene. Many alternatively spliced transcript variants, some of which
        are disease-associated mutations, have been described for this gene, but the
        full-length natures of only some of these variants has been described. A related
        pseudogene, which is also located on chromosome 17, has been identified. [provided

        APP: This gene encodes a cell surface receptor and transmembrane precursor
        protein that is cleaved by secretases to form a number of peptides. Some of
        these peptides are secreted and can bind to the acetyltransferase complex
        APBB1/TIP60 to promote transcriptional activation, while others form the protein
        basis of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer
        disease. In addition, two of the peptides are antimicrobial peptides, having
        been shown to have bacteriocidal and antifungal activities. Mutations in this

        amyloidosis (cerebral amyloid angiopathy). Multiple transcript variants encoding

        LYN: This gene encodes a tyrosine protein kinase, which maybe involved in
        the regulation of mast cell degranulation, and erythroid differentiation.

        been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2011]


        GSTM3: Cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of glutathione S-transferase are
        encoded by two distinct supergene families. At present, eight distinct classes
        of the soluble cytoplasmic mammalian glutathione S-transferases have been
        identified: alpha, kappa, mu, omega, pi, sigma, theta and zeta. This gene
        encodes a glutathione S-transferase that belongs to the mu class. The mu class
        of enzymes functions in the detoxification of electrophilic compounds, including
        carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative
        stress, by conjugation with glutathione. The genes encoding the mu class of
        enzymes are organized in a gene cluster on chromosome 1p13.3 and are known
        to be highly polymorphic. These genetic variations can change an individual''s
        susceptibility to carcinogens and toxins as well as affect the toxicity and
        efficacy of certain drugs. Mutations of this class mu gene have been linked
        with a slight increase in a number of cancers, likely due to exposure with
        environmental toxins. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2008]


        PCSK9: This gene encodes a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase
        family, which includes proteases that process protein and peptide precursors
        trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway.
        The encoded protein undergoes an autocatalytic processing event with its prosegment
        in the ER and is constitutively secreted as an inactive protease into the
        extracellular matrix and trans-Golgi network. It is expressed in liver, intestine
        and kidney tissues and escorts specific receptors for lysosomal degradation.
        It plays a role in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. Mutations in this
        gene have been associated with autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia.
        Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by
        RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        MAL: The protein encoded by this gene is a highly hydrophobic integral membrane
        protein belonging to the MAL family of proteolipids. The protein has been
        localized to the endoplasmic reticulum of T-cells and is a candidate linker
        protein in T-cell signal transduction. In addition, this proteolipid is localized
        in compact myelin of cells in the nervous system and has been implicated in
        myelin biogenesis and/or function. The protein plays a role in the formation,
        stabilization and maintenance of glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains.
        Down-regulation of this gene has been associated with a variety of human epithelial
        malignancies. Alternative splicing produces four transcript variants which
        vary from each other by the presence or absence of alternatively spliced exons
        2 and 3. [provided by RefSeq, May 2012]


        AFAP1L2: Enables SH2 domain binding activity; SH3 domain binding activity;
        and protein tyrosine kinase activator activity. Involved in several processes,
        including positive regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling
        pathway; regulation of gene expression; and regulation of mitotic cell cycle.
        Located in cytosol and plasma membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources,

        PKHD1: The protein encoded by this gene is predicted to have a single transmembrane
        (TM)-spanning domain and multiple copies of an immunoglobulin-like plexin-transcription-factor
        domain. Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms. Other alternatively spliced transcripts have been described, but
        the full length sequences have not been determined. Several of these transcripts
        are predicted to encode truncated products which lack the TM and may be secreted.
        Mutations in this gene cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease,
        also known as polycystic kidney and hepatic disease-1. [provided by RefSeq,

        ATP6V0A4: This gene encodes a component of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit
        enzyme that mediates acidification of intracellular compartments of eukaryotic
        cells. V-ATPase dependent acidification is necessary for such intracellular
        processes as protein sorting, zymogen activation, receptor-mediated endocytosis,
        and synaptic vesicle proton gradient generation. V-ATPase is composed of a
        cytosolic V1 domain and a transmembrane V0 domain. The V1 domain consists
        of three A and three B subunits, two G subunits plus the C, D, E, F, and H
        subunits. The V1 domain contains the ATP catalytic site. The V0 domain consists
        of five different subunits: a, c, c'', c'''', and d. This gene is one of four
        genes in man and mouse that encode different isoforms of the a subunit. Alternatively
        spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been described.
        Mutations in this gene are associated with renal tubular acidosis associated
        with preserved hearing. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        NCOA6: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional coactivator that
        can interact with nuclear hormone receptors to enhance their transcriptional
        activator functions. This protein has been shown to be involved in the hormone-dependent
        coactivation of several receptors, including prostanoid, retinoid, vitamin
        D3, thyroid hormone, and steroid receptors. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene. [provided

        FLOT2: Caveolae are small domains on the inner cell membrane involved in vesicular
        trafficking and signal transduction. This gene encodes a caveolae-associated,
        integral membrane protein, which is thought to function in neuronal signaling.
        [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        CROCC: Predicted to enable kinesin binding activity and structural molecule
        activity. Involved in several processes, including centriole-centriole cohesion;
        positive regulation of cilium assembly; and positive regulation of protein
        localization to cilium. Located in cytoskeleton; cytosol; and plasma membrane.

        CD160: CD160 is an 27 kDa glycoprotein which was initially identified with
        the monoclonal antibody BY55. Its expression is tightly associated with peripheral
        blood NK cells and CD8 T lymphocytes with cytolytic effector activity. The
        cDNA sequence of CD160 predicts a cysteine-rich, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored
        protein of 181 amino acids with a single Ig-like domain weakly homologous
        to KIR2DL4 molecule. CD160 is expressed at the cell surface as a tightly disulfide-linked
        multimer. RNA blot analysis revealed CD160 mRNAs of 1.5 and 1.6 kb whose expression
        was highly restricted to circulating NK and T cells, spleen and small intestine.
        Within NK cells CD160 is expressed by CD56dimCD16+ cells whereas among circulating
        T cells its expression is mainly restricted to TCRgd bearing cells and to
        TCRab+CD8brightCD95+CD56+CD28-CD27-cells. In tissues, CD160 is expressed on
        all intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes. CD160 shows a broad specificity
        for binding to both classical and nonclassical MHC class I molecules. [provided

        SLC2A4: This gene is a member of the solute carrier family 2 (facilitated
        glucose transporter) family and encodes a protein that functions as an insulin-regulated
        facilitative glucose transporter. In the absence of insulin, this integral
        membrane protein is sequestered within the cells of muscle and adipose tissue.
        Within minutes of insulin stimulation, the protein moves to the cell surface
        and begins to transport glucose across the cell membrane. Mutations in this
        gene have been associated with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).

        SHROOM2: This gene represents the human homolog of Xenopus laevis apical protein
        (APX) gene, which is implicated in amiloride-sensitive sodium channel activity.
        It is expressed in endothelial cells and facilitates the formation of a contractile
        network within endothelial cells. Depletion of this gene results in an increase
        in endothelial sprouting, migration, and angiogenesis. This gene is highly
        expressed in the retina, and is a strong candidate for ocular albinism type
        1 syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for
        this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2016]


        ADIPOR2: The adiponectin receptors, ADIPOR1 (MIM 607945) and ADIPOR2, serve
        as receptors for globular and full-length adiponectin (MIM 605441) and mediate
        increased AMPK (see MIM 602739) and PPAR-alpha (PPARA; MIM 170998) ligand
        activities, as well as fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake by adiponectin
        (Yamauchi et al., 2003 [PubMed 12802337]).[supplied by OMIM, Mar 2008]


        ADAM10: Members of the ADAM family are cell surface proteins with a unique
        structure possessing both potential adhesion and protease domains. This gene
        encodes and ADAM family member that cleaves many proteins including TNF-alpha
        and E-cadherin. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants
        encoding different proteins that may undergo similar processing. [provided
        by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        EPHB4: Ephrin receptors and their ligands, the ephrins, mediate numerous developmental
        processes, particularly in the nervous system. Based on their structures and
        sequence relationships, ephrins are divided into the ephrin-A (EFNA) class,
        which are anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage,
        and the ephrin-B (EFNB) class, which are transmembrane proteins. The Eph family
        of receptors are divided into 2 groups based on the similarity of their extracellular
        domain sequences and their affinities for binding ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands.
        Ephrin receptors make up the largest subgroup of the receptor tyrosine kinase
        (RTK) family. The protein encoded by this gene binds to ephrin-B2 and plays
        an essential role in vascular development. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        IL2RG: The protein encoded by this gene is an important signaling component
        of many interleukin receptors, including those of interleukin -2, -4, -7 and
        -21, and is thus referred to as the common gamma chain. Mutations in this
        gene cause X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID), as well as X-linked
        combined immunodeficiency (XCID), a less severe immunodeficiency disorder.
        [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2010]


        IL2RB: The interleukin 2 receptor, which is involved in T cell-mediated immune
        responses, is present in 3 forms with respect to ability to bind interleukin
        2. The low affinity form is a monomer of the alpha subunit and is not involved
        in signal transduction. The intermediate affinity form consists of an alpha/beta
        subunit heterodimer, while the high affinity form consists of an alpha/beta/gamma
        subunit heterotrimer. Both the intermediate and high affinity forms of the
        receptor are involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis and transduction of
        mitogenic signals from interleukin 2. The protein encoded by this gene represents
        the beta subunit and is a type I membrane protein. The use of alternative
        promoters results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein.
        The protein is primarily expressed in the hematopoietic system. The use by
        some variants of an alternate promoter in an upstream long terminal repeat
        (LTR) results in placenta-specific expression. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2016]


        SLC34A3: This gene encodes a member of SLC34A transporter family of proteins,
        and is expressed primarily in the kidney. It is involved in transporting phosphate
        into cells via sodium cotransport in the renal brush border membrane, and
        contributes to the maintenance of inorganic phosphate concentration in the
        kidney. Mutations in this gene are associated with hereditary hypophosphatemic
        rickets with hypercalciuria. Alternatively spliced transcript variants varying
        in the 5'' UTR have been found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Apr 2010]


        SCUBE1: This gene encodes a cell surface glycoprotein that is a member of
        the SCUBE (signal peptide, CUB domain, EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like
        protein) family. Family members have an amino-terminal signal peptide, nine
        copies of EGF-like repeats and a CUB domain at the carboxyl terminus. This
        protein is expressed in platelets and endothelial cells and may play an important
        role in vascular biology. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2011]


        PLAUR: This gene encodes the receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator
        and, given its role in localizing and promoting plasmin formation, likely
        influences many normal and pathological processes related to cell-surface
        plasminogen activation and localized degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        It binds both the proprotein and mature forms of urokinase plasminogen activator
        and permits the activation of the receptor-bound pro-enzyme by plasmin. The
        protein lacks transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains and may be anchored to
        the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety following
        cleavage of the nascent polypeptide near its carboxy-terminus. However, a
        soluble protein is also produced in some cell types. Alternative splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. The proprotein
        experiences several post-translational cleavage reactions that have not yet
        been fully defined. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        GATA3: This gene encodes a protein which belongs to the GATA family of transcription
        factors. The protein contains two GATA-type zinc fingers and is an important
        regulator of T-cell development and plays an important role in endothelial
        cell biology. Defects in this gene are the cause of hypoparathyroidism with
        sensorineural deafness and renal dysplasia. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2009]

        SULF2: Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) act as coreceptors for numerous
        heparin-binding growth factors and cytokines and are involved in cell signaling.
        Heparan sulfate 6-O-endosulfatases, such as SULF2, selectively remove 6-O-sulfate
        groups from heparan sulfate. This activity modulates the effects of heparan
        sulfate by altering binding sites for signaling molecules (Dai et al., 2005
        [PubMed 16192265]).[supplied by OMIM, Mar 2008]


        AKAP7: This gene encodes a member of the A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP)
        family, a group of functionally related proteins that bind to a regulatory
        subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and target the enzyme
        to specific subcellular compartments. AKAPs have a common RII-binding domain,
        but contain different targeting motifs responsible for directing PKA to distinct
        intracellular locations. Three alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms have been described.[provided by RefSeq, Apr 2011]


        B4GALT1: This gene is one of seven beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT)
        genes. They encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have
        exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose; all transfer
        galactose in a beta1,4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars: GlcNAc, Glc, and
        Xyl. Each beta4GalT has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different
        glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they
        have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to
        the Golgi apparatus and which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane
        anchor. By sequence similarity, the beta4GalTs form four groups: beta4GalT1
        and beta4GalT2, beta4GalT3 and beta4GalT4, beta4GalT5 and beta4GalT6, and
        beta4GalT7. This gene is unique among the beta4GalT genes because it encodes
        an enzyme that participates both in glycoconjugate and lactose biosynthesis.
        For the first activity, the enzyme adds galactose to N-acetylglucosamine residues
        that are either monosaccharides or the nonreducing ends of glycoprotein carbohydrate
        chains. The second activity is restricted to lactating mammary tissues where
        the enzyme forms a heterodimer with alpha-lactalbumin to catalyze UDP-galactose
        + D-glucose <=> UDP + lactose. The two enzymatic forms result from alternate
        transcription initiation sites and post-translational processing. Two transcripts,
        which differ only at the 5'' end, with approximate lengths of 4.1 kb and 3.9
        kb encode the same protein. The longer transcript encodes the type II membrane-bound,
        trans-Golgi resident protein involved in glycoconjugate biosynthesis. The
        shorter transcript encodes a protein which is cleaved to form the soluble
        lactose synthase. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        IL2RB: The interleukin 2 receptor, which is involved in T cell-mediated immune
        responses, is present in 3 forms with respect to ability to bind interleukin
        2. The low affinity form is a monomer of the alpha subunit and is not involved
        in signal transduction. The intermediate affinity form consists of an alpha/beta
        subunit heterodimer, while the high affinity form consists of an alpha/beta/gamma
        subunit heterotrimer. Both the intermediate and high affinity forms of the
        receptor are involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis and transduction of
        mitogenic signals from interleukin 2. The protein encoded by this gene represents
        the beta subunit ...

        copies of EGF-like repeats and a CUB domain at the carboxy...


        PLAUR: This gene encodes the receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator
        and, given its role in localizing and promoting plasmin formation, likely

        plasminogen activation and localized degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        It binds both the proprotein and mature forms of urokinase plasminogen activator
        and permits the activation of the receptor-bound pro-enzyme by plasmin. The

        B4GALT1: This gene is one of seven beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT)
        genes. They encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have
        exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose; all transfer
        galactose in a beta1,4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars: GlcNAc, Glc, and
        Xyl. Each beta4GalT has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different
        glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they
        have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to
        the Golgi apparatus and which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane
        anchor. By sequence similarity, the beta4GalTs form four groups: beta4GalT1
        and beta4GalT2, beta4GalT3 and beta4GalT4, beta4GalT5 and beta4GalT6, and
        beta4GalT7. This gene is unique among the beta4GalT genes because it encodes
        an enzyme that participates both in glycoconjugate and lactose biosynthesis.
        For the first activity, the enzyme adds galactose to N-acetylglucosamine residues
        that are either monosaccharides or the nonreducing ends of glycoprotein carbohydrate
        chains. The second activity is restricted t...

        B4GALT1: This gene is one of seven beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT)
        genes. They encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have
        exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose; all transfer
        galactose in a beta1,4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars: GlcNAc, Glc, and
        Xyl. Each beta4GalT has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different
        glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they
        have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to
        the Golgi apparatus and which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane
        anchor. By sequence similarity, the beta4GalTs form four groups: beta4GalT1
        and beta4GalT2, beta4GalT3 and beta4GalT4, beta4GalT5 and beta4GalT6, and
        beta4GalT7. This gene is unique among the beta4GalT genes because it encodes

        PLAUR: This gene encodes the receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator
        and, given its role in localizing and promoting plasmin formation, likely
        influences many normal and pathological processes related to cell-surface
        plasminogen activation and localized degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        It binds both the proprotein and mature forms of urokinase plasminogen activator
        and permits the activation of the receptor-bound pro-enzyme by plasmin. The
        protein lacks transmembrane or cytoplasmi...


        GATA3: This gene encodes a protein which belongs to the GATA family of transcription
        factors. The protein contains two GATA-type zinc fingers and is an important
        regulator of T-cell development and pla...

        SULF2: Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) act as coreceptors for numerous
        heparin-binding growth factors and cytokines and are involved in cell signaling.
        Heparan sulfate 6-O-endosulfatases, such as SULF2, selectively remove ...


        AKAP7: This gene encodes a member of the A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP)
        family, a group of functionally related proteins that bind to a regulatory
        subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and target the enzyme
        to specific subcellular compartments. AKAPs have a ...


        B4GALT1: This gene is one of seven beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT)
        genes. They encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have
        exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose; all transfer
        galactose in a beta1,4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars: GlcNAc, Glc, and
        Xyl. Each beta4GalT has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different
        glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they
        have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to
        the Golgi apparatus and which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane
        anchor. By sequence similarity, the beta4GalTs form four groups: beta4GalT1
        and beta4GalT2, beta4GalT3 and beta4GalT4, beta4GalT5 and beta4GalT6, and
        beta4GalT7. This gene is unique among the beta4GalT genes because it encodes
        an enzyme that participates both in glycoconjugate and lactose...
