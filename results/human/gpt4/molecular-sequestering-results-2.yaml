          Here are the gene summaries:


          C1R: This gene encodes a member of the peptidase S1 protein family. The encoded protein is a proteolytic subunit in the complement system C1 complex. The complement system acts as a mediator in the innate immune response by ultimately triggering phagocytosis, inflammation, and rupturing the bacterial cell wall. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2018]

          CASQ2: The protein encoded by this gene specifies the cardiac muscle family member of the calsequestrin family. Calsequestrin is localized to the sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiac and slow skeletal muscle cells. The protein is a calcium binding protein that stores calcium for muscle function. Mutations in this gene cause stress-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, also referred to as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia 2 (CPVT2), a disease characterized by bidirectional ventricular tachycardia that may lead to cardiac arrest. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          CASTOR1: Enables arginine binding activity and identical protein binding activity. Involved in cellular response to L-arginine and negative regulation of TORC1 signaling. Located in cytosol. Colocalizes with GATOR2 complex. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          CDKN1A: This gene encodes a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. The encoded protein binds to and inhibits the activity of cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase2 or -cyclin-dependent kinase4 complexes, and thus functions as a regulator of cell cycle progression at G1. The expression of this gene is tightly controlled by the tumor suppressor protein p53, through which this protein mediates the p53-dependent cell cycle G1 phase arrest in response to a variety of stress stimuli. This protein can interact with proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a DNA polymerase accessory factor, and plays a regulatory role in S phase DNA replication and DNA damage repair. This protein was reported to be specifically cleaved by CASP3-like caspases, which thus leads to a dramatic activation of cyclin-dependent kinase2, and may be instrumental in the execution of apoptosis following caspase activation. Mice that lack this gene have the ability to regenerate damaged or missing tissue. Multiple alternatively spliced variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]

          DDX56: This gene encodes a member of the DEAD box protein family. DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. The protein encoded by this gene shows ATPase activity in the presence of polynucleotides and associates with nucleoplasmic 65S preribosomal particles. This gene may be involved in ribosome synthesis, most likely during assembly of the large 60S ribosomal subunit. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012]

          EPN1: This gene encodes a member of the epsin protein family. The encoded protein binds clathrin and is involved in the endocytosis of clathrin-coated vesicles.

          FTH1: This gene encodes the heavy subunit of ferritin, the major intracellular iron storage protein in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It is composed of 24 subunits of the heavy and light ferritin chains. Variation in ferritin subunit composition may affect the rates of iron uptake and release in different tissues. A major function of ferritin is the storage of iron in a soluble and nontoxic state. Defects in ferritin proteins are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. This gene has multiple pseudogenes. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed, but their biological validity has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          GOPC: This gene encodes a Golgi protein with a PDZ domain. The PDZ domain is globular and proteins which contain them bind other proteins through short motifs near the C-termini. Mice which are deficient in the orthologous protein have globozoospermia and are infertile. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]

          INSIG1: This gene encodes an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein that regulates cholesterol metabolism, lipogenesis, and glucose homeostasis. The encoded protein has six transmembrane helices which contain an effector protein binding site. It binds the sterol-sensing domains of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), and is essential for the sterol-mediated trafficking of these two proteins. It promotes the endoplasmic reticulum retention of SCAP and the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2016]

          INSIG2: The protein encoded by this gene is highly similar to the protein product encoded by gene INSIG1. Both INSIG1 protein and this protein are endoplasmic reticulum proteins that block the processing of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) by binding to SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), and thus prevent SCAP from escorting SREBPs to the Golgi. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          LAPTM5: This gene encodes a transmembrane receptor that is associated with lysosomes. The encoded protein, also known as E3 protein, may play a role in hematopoiesis. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2009]

The protein encoded by this gene is a neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and plays a role in innate immunity by limiting bacterial growth as a result of sequestering iron-containing siderophores. The presence of this protein in blood and urine is an early biomarker of acute kidney injury. This protein is thought to be be involved in multiple cellular processes, including maintenance of skin homeostasis, and suppression of invasiveness and metastasis. Mice lacking this gene are more susceptible to bacterial infection than wild type mice. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]

          NFKBIA: This gene encodes a member of the NF-kappa-B inhibitor family, which contain multiple ankrin repeat domains. The encoded protein interacts with REL dimers to inhibit NF-kappa-B/REL complexes which are involved in inflammatory responses. The encoded protein moves between the cytoplasm and the nucleus via a nuclear localization signal and CRM1-mediated nuclear export. Mutations in this gene have been found in ectodermal dysplasia anhidrotic with T-cell immunodeficiency autosomal dominant disease. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]

          PRDX4: The protein encoded by this gene is an antioxidant enzyme and belongs to the peroxiredoxin family. The protein is localized to the cytoplasm. Peroxidases of the peroxiredoxin family reduce hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides to water and alcohol with the use of reducing equivalents derived from thiol-containing donor molecules. This protein has been found to play a regulatory role in the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          PRNP: The protein encoded by this gene is a membrane glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein that tends to aggregate into rod-like structures. The encoded protein contains a highly unstable region of five tandem octapeptide repeats. This gene is found on chromosome 20, approximately 20 kbp upstream of a gene which encodes a biochemically and structurally similar protein to the one encoded by this gene. Mutations in the repeat region as well as elsewhere in this gene have been associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fatal familial insomnia, Gerstmann-Straussler disease, Huntington disease-like 1, and kuru. An overlapping open reading frame has been found for this gene that encodes a smaller, structurally unrelated protein, AltPrp. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]

          S100A7: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the S100 family of proteins containing 2 EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. S100 proteins are localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, and involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. S100 genes include at least 13 members which are located as a cluster on chromosome 1q21. This protein differs from the other S100 proteins of known structure in its lack of calcium binding ability in one EF-hand at the N-terminus. The protein is overexpressed in hyperproliferative skin diseases, exhibits antimicrobial activities against bacteria and induces immunomodulatory activities. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]

          SEC14L1: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the SEC14 cytosolic factor family. It has similarity to yeast SEC14 and to Japanese flying squid RALBP which suggests a possible role of the gene product in an intracellular transport system. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene; some variants represent read-through transcripts that include exons from the upstream gene C17orf86. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2011]

The protein can also regulate alternative splicing of target genes. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          STAT3: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the STAT protein family. In response to cytokines and growth factors, STAT family members are phosphorylated by the receptor associated kinases, and then form homo- or heterodimers that translocate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription activators. This protein is activated through phosphorylation in response to various cytokines and growth factors including IFNs, EGF, IL5, IL6, HGF, LIF and BMP2. This protein mediates the expression of a variety of genes in response to cell stimuli, and thus plays a key role in many cellular processes such as cell growth and apoptosis. The small GTPase Rac1 has been shown to bind and regulate the activity of this protein. PIAS3 protein is a specific inhibitor of this protein. This gene also plays a role in regulating host response to viral and bacterial infections.

          TMC8: Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is an autosomal recessive dermatosis characterized by abnormal susceptibility to human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and a high rate of progression to squamous cell carcinoma on sun-exposed skin. EV is caused by mutations in either of two adjacent genes located on chromosome 17q25.3. Both of these genes encode integral membrane proteins that localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and are predicted to form transmembrane channels. This gene encodes a transmembrane channel-like protein with 8 predicted transmembrane domains and 3 leucine zipper motifs. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described, but their biological validity has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          TSSC4: This gene is one of several tumor-suppressing subtransferable fragments located in the imprinted gene domain of 11p15.5, an important tumor-suppressor gene region. Alterations in this region have been associated with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, and lung, ovarian, and breast cancer. This gene is located among several imprinted genes; however, this gene, as well as the pan-hematopoietic expression gene (PHEMX), escapes imprinting.

          STAT3: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the STAT protein family. In response to cytokines and growth factors, STAT family members are phosphorylated by the receptor associated kinases, and then form homo- or heterodimers that translocate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription activators. This protein is activated through phosphorylation in response to various cytokines and growth factors including IFNs, EGF, IL5, IL6, HGF, LIF and BMP2. This protein mediates the expression of a variety of genes in response to cell stimuli, and thus plays a key role in many cellular processes such as cell growth and apoptosis.

          Here are the gene summaries:


          C1R: This gene encodes a member of the peptidase S1 protein family. The encoded protein is a proteolytic subunit in the complement system C1 complex. The complement system acts as a mediator in the innate immune response by ultimately triggering phagocytosis, inflammation, and rupturing the bacterial cell wall. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2018]

          CASQ2: The protein encoded by this gene specifies the cardiac muscle family member of the calsequestrin family. Calsequestrin is localized to the sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiac and slow skeletal muscle cells. The protein is a calcium binding protein that stores calcium for muscle function. Mutations in this gene cause stress-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, also referred to as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia 2 (CPVT2), a disease characterized by bidirectional ventricular tachycardia that may lead to cardiac arrest. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          CASTOR1: Enables arginine binding activity and identical protein binding activity. Involved in cellular response to L-arginine and negative regulation of TORC1 signaling. Located in cytosol. Colocalizes with GATOR2 complex. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          CDKN1A: This gene encodes a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. The encoded protein binds to and inhibits the activity of cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase2 or -cyclin-dependent kinase4 complexes, and thus functions as a regulator of cell cycle progression at G1. The expression of this gene is tightly controlled by the tumor suppressor protein p53, through which this protein mediates the p53-dependent cell cycle G1 phase arrest in response to a variety of stress stimuli. This protein can interact with proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a DNA polymerase accessory factor, and plays a regulatory role in S phase DNA replication and DNA damage repair. This protein was reported to be specifically cleaved by CASP3-like caspases, which thus leads to a dramatic activation of cyclin-dependent kinase2, and may be instrumental in the execution of apoptosis following caspase activation. Mice that lack this gene have the ability to regenerate damaged or missing tissue. Multiple alternatively spliced variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]

          DDX56: This gene encodes a member of the DEAD box protein family. DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. The protein encoded by this gene shows ATPase activity in the presence of polynucleotides and associates with nucleoplasmic 65S preribosomal particles. This gene may be involved in ribosome synthesis, most likely during assembly of the large 60S ribosomal subunit. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012]

          EPN1: This gene encodes a member of the epsin protein family. The encoded protein binds clathrin and is involved in the endocytosis of clathrin-coated vesicles. Loss of function of this gene is associated with reduced tumor growth and progression in certain cancer types. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2016]

          FTH1: This gene encodes the heavy subunit of ferritin, the major intracellular iron storage protein in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It is composed of 24 subunits of the heavy and light ferritin chains. Variation in ferritin subunit composition may affect the rates of iron uptake and release in different tissues. A major function of ferritin is the storage of iron in a soluble and nontoxic state. Defects in ferritin proteins are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. This gene has multiple pseudogenes. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed, but their biological validity has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          GOPC: This gene encodes a Golgi protein with a PDZ domain. The PDZ domain is globular and proteins which contain them bind other proteins through short motifs near the C-termini. Mice which are deficient in the orthologous protein have globozoospermia and are infertile. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]

          HSPBP1: Enables ubiquitin protein ligase binding activity. Involved in positive regulation of proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process and positive regulation of protein ubiquitination. Predicted to be active in endoplasmic reticulum. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          IMPACT: Predicted to enable actin binding activity and ribosome binding activity. Predicted to be involved in several processes, including GCN2-mediated signaling; cellular response to starvation; and negative regulation of nitrogen compound metabolic process. Predicted to be located in cytoplasm. Predicted to be part of polysome. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          INSIG1: This gene encodes an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein that regulates cholesterol metabolism, lipogenesis, and glucose homeostasis. The encoded protein has six transmembrane helices which contain an effector protein binding site. It binds the sterol-sensing domains of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), and is essential for the sterol-mediated trafficking of these two proteins. It promotes the endoplasmic reticulum retention of SCAP and the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2016]

          INSIG2: The protein encoded by this gene is highly similar to the protein product encoded by gene INSIG1. Both INSIG1 protein and this protein are endoplasmic reticulum proteins that block the processing of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) by binding to SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), and thus prevent SCAP from escorting SREBPs to the Golgi. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          LAPTM5: This gene encodes a transmembrane receptor that is associated with lysosomes. The encoded protein, also known as E3 protein, may play a role in hematopoiesis. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2009]

          LCN2: This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the lipocalin family. Members of this family transport small hydrophobic molecules such as lipids, steroid hormones and retinoids. The protein encoded by this gene is a neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and plays a role in innate immunity by limiting bacterial growth as a result of sequestering iron-containing siderophores. The presence of this protein in blood and urine is an early biomarker of acute kidney injury. This protein is thought to be be involved in multiple cellular processes, including maintenance of skin homeostasis, and suppression of invasiveness and metastasis. Mice lacking this gene are more susceptible to bacterial infection than wild type mice. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]

          NFKBIA: This gene encodes a member of the NF-kappa-B inhibitor family, which contain multiple ankrin repeat domains. The encoded protein interacts with REL dimers to inhibit NF-kappa-B/REL complexes which are involved in inflammatory responses. The encoded protein moves between the cytoplasm and the nucleus via a nuclear localization signal and CRM1-mediated nuclear export. Mutations in this gene have been found in ectodermal dysplasia anhidrotic with T-cell immunodeficiency autosomal dominant disease. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]

          PRDX4: The protein encoded by this gene is an antioxidant enzyme and belongs to the peroxiredoxin family. The protein is localized to the cytoplasm. Peroxidases of the peroxiredoxin family reduce hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides to water and alcohol with the use of reducing equivalents derived from thiol-containing donor molecules. This protein has been found to play a regulatory role in the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          PRNP: The protein encoded by this gene is a membrane glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein that tends to aggregate into rod-like structures. The encoded protein contains a highly unstable region of five tandem octapeptide repeats. This gene is found on chromosome 20, approximately 20 kbp upstream of a gene which encodes a biochemically and structurally similar protein to the one encoded by this gene. Mutations in the repeat region as well as elsewhere in this gene have been associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fatal familial insomnia, Gerstmann-Straussler disease, Huntington disease-like 1, and kuru. An overlapping open reading frame has been found for this gene that encodes a smaller, structurally unrelated protein, AltPrp. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

S100 proteins are localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, and involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. S100 genes include at least 13 members which are located as a cluster on chromosome 1q21. This protein differs from the other S100 proteins of known structure in its lack of calcium binding ability in one EF-hand at the N-terminus. The protein is overexpressed in hyperproliferative skin diseases, exhibits antimicrobial activities against bacteria and induces immunomodulatory activities. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]

          Here are the gene summaries:


          C1R: This gene encodes a member of the peptidase S1 protein family. The encoded protein is a proteolytic subunit in the complement system C1 complex. The complement system acts as a mediator in the innate immune response by ultimately triggering phagocytosis, inflammation, and rupturing the bacterial cell wall. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2018]

          CASQ2: The protein encoded by this gene specifies the cardiac muscle family member of the calsequestrin family. Calsequestrin is localized to the sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiac and slow skeletal muscle cells. The protein is a calcium binding protein that stores calcium for muscle function. Mutations in this gene cause stress-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, also referred to as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia 2 (CPVT2), a disease characterized by bidirectional ventricular tachycardia that may lead to cardiac arrest. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          CASTOR1: Enables arginine binding activity and identical protein binding activity. Involved in cellular response to L-arginine and negative regulation of TORC1 signaling. Located in cytosol. Colocalizes with GATOR2 complex. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          CDKN1A: This gene encodes a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. The encoded protein binds to and inhibits the activity of cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase2 or -cyclin-dependent kinase4 complexes, and thus functions as a regulator of cell cycle progression at G1. The expression of this gene is tightly controlled by the tumor suppressor protein p53, through which this protein mediates the p53-dependent cell cycle G1 phase arrest in response to a variety of stress stimuli. This protein can interact with proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a DNA polymerase accessory factor, and plays a regulatory role in S phase DNA replication and DNA damage repair. This protein was reported to be specifically cleaved by CASP3-like caspases, which thus leads to a dramatic activation of cyclin-dependent kinase2, and may be instrumental in the execution of apoptosis following caspase activation. Mice that lack this gene have the ability to regenerate damaged or missing tissue. Multiple alternatively spliced variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]

          DDX56: This gene encodes a member of the DEAD box protein family. DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. The protein encoded by this gene shows ATPase activity in the presence of polynucleotides and associates with nucleoplasmic 65S preribosomal particles. This gene may be involved in ribosome synthesis, most likely during assembly of the large 60S ribosomal subunit. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012]

          EPN1: This gene encodes a member of the epsin protein family. The encoded protein binds clathrin and is involved in the endocytosis of clathrin-coated vesicles.

          FTH1: This gene encodes the heavy subunit of ferritin, the major intracellular iron storage protein in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It is composed of 24 subunits of the heavy and light ferritin chains. Variation in ferritin subunit composition may affect the rates of iron uptake and release in different tissues. A major function of ferritin is the storage of iron in a soluble and nontoxic state. Defects in ferritin proteins are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. This gene has multiple pseudogenes. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed, but their biological validity has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          GOPC: This gene encodes a Golgi protein with a PDZ domain. The PDZ domain is globular and proteins which contain them bind other proteins through short motifs near the C-termini. Mice which are deficient in the orthologous protein have globozoospermia and are infertile. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]

          HSPBP1: Enables ubiquitin protein ligase binding activity. Involved in positive regulation of proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process and positive regulation of protein ubiquitination. Predicted to be active in endoplasmic reticulum. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          IMPACT: Predicted to enable actin binding activity and ribosome binding activity. Predicted to be involved in several processes, including GCN2-mediated signaling; cellular response to starvation; and negative regulation of nitrogen compound metabolic process. Predicted to be located in cytoplasm. Predicted to be part of polysome. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          INSIG1: This gene encodes an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein that regulates cholesterol metabolism, lipogenesis, and glucose homeostasis. The encoded protein has six transmembrane helices which contain an effector protein binding site. It binds the sterol-sensing domains of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), and is essential for the sterol-mediated trafficking of these two proteins. It promotes the endoplasmic reticulum retention of SCAP and the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2016]

          INSIG2: The protein encoded by this gene is highly similar to the protein product encoded by gene INSIG1. Both INSIG1 protein and this protein are endoplasmic reticulum proteins that block the processing of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) by binding to SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), and thus prevent SCAP from escorting SREBPs to the Golgi. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          LAPTM5: This gene encodes a transmembrane receptor that is associated with lysosomes. The encoded protein, also known as E3 protein, may play a role in hematopoiesis. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2009]

          LCN2: This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the lipocalin family. Members of this family transport small hydrophobic molecules such as lipids, steroid hormones and retinoids. The protein encoded by this gene is a neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and plays a role in innate immunity by limiting bacterial growth as a result of sequestering iron-containing siderophores. The presence of this protein in blood and urine is an early biomarker of acute kidney injury. This protein is thought to be be involved in multiple cellular processes, including maintenance of skin homeostasis, and suppression of invasiveness and metastasis. Mice lacking this gene are more susceptible to bacterial infection than wild type mice. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]

          NFKBIA: This gene encodes a member of the NF-kappa-B inhibitor family, which contain multiple ankrin repeat domains. The encoded protein interacts with REL dimers to inhibit NF-kappa-B/REL complexes which are involved in inflammatory responses. The encoded protein moves between the cytoplasm and the nucleus via a nuclear localization signal and CRM1-mediated nuclear export. Mutations in this gene have been found in ectodermal dysplasia anhidrotic with T-cell immunodeficiency autosomal dominant disease. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]

          PRDX4: The protein encoded by this gene is an antioxidant enzyme and belongs to the peroxiredoxin family. The protein is localized to the cytoplasm. Peroxidases of the peroxiredoxin family reduce hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides to water and alcohol with the use of reducing equivalents derived from thiol-containing donor molecules. This protein has been found to play a regulatory role in the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          PRNP: The protein encoded by this gene is a membrane glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein that tends to aggregate into rod-like structures. The encoded protein contains a highly unstable region of five tandem octapeptide repeats. This gene is found on chromosome 20, approximately 20 kbp upstream of a gene which encodes a biochemically and structurally similar protein to the one encoded by this gene. Mutations in the repeat region as well as elsewhere in this gene have been associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fatal familial insomnia, Gerstmann-Straussler disease, Huntington disease-like 1, and kuru. An overlapping open reading frame has been found for this gene that encodes a smaller, structurally unrelated protein, AltPrp. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

S100 proteins are localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, and involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. S100 genes include at least 13 members which are located as a cluster on chromosome 1q21. This protein differs from the other S100 proteins of known structure in its lack of calcium binding ability in one EF-hand at the N-terminus. The protein is overexpressed in hyperproliferative skin diseases, exhibits antimicrobial activities against bacteria and induces immunomodulatory activities. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]

The protein can also regulate alternative splicing of target genes. Multiple tra...

          STAT3: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the STAT protein family. In response to cytokines and growth factors, STAT family members are phosphorylated by the receptor associated kinases, and then form homo- or heterodimers that translocate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription activators. This protein is activated through phosphorylation in response to various cytokines and growth factors including IFNs, EGF, IL5, IL6, HGF, LIF and BMP2. This protein mediates the expression of a variety of genes in response to cell stimuli, and thus plays a key role in many cellular processes such as cell growth and apoptosis. The small GTPase Rac1 has been shown to bind and regulate the activity of this protein. PIAS3 protein is a specific inhibitor of this protein. This gene also plays a role in regulating ...

          TCN1: This gene encodes a member of the vitamin B12-binding protein family. This family of proteins, alternatively referred to as R binders, is expressed in various tissues and secretions. This protein is a major constituent of secondary granules in neutrophils and facilitates ...

          TMC8: Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is an autosomal recessive dermatosis characterized by abnormal susceptibility to human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and a high rate of progression to squamous cell carcinoma on sun-exposed skin. EV is caused by mutations in either of two adjacent genes located on chromosome 17q25.3. Both of these genes encode integral membrane proteins that localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and are predicted to form transmembrane channels. This gene encodes a transmemb...

          TRIM15: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family. The TRIM motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a RING, a B-box type 1 and a B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region. The protein localizes to the cytoplasm. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described, but th...

          TSSC4: This gene is one of several tumor-suppressing subtransferable fragments located in the imprinted gene domain of 11p15.5, an important tumor-suppressor gene region. Alterations in this region have been associated with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, and lung, ovarian, and breast cancer. This gene is located among several imprinted genes; however, this gene, as well as the pan-hematopoietic expression gene (PHEMX), escapes imprinting. This gene may play a role in malignancies and disease that in...

          XAF1: This gene encodes a protein which binds to and counteracts the inhibitory effect of a member of the IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) protein family. IAP proteins bind to and inhibit caspases which are activated during apoptosis. The proportion of IAPs and proteins which interfere with their activity, such as the encoded protein, affect the progress of the apoptosis signaling pathway. Multiple transcri...

          YWHAZ: This gene product belongs to the 14-3-3 family of proteins which mediate signal transduction by binding to phosphoserine-containing proteins. This highly conserved protein family is found in both plants and mammals, and this protein is 99% identical to the mouse, rat and sheep orthologs.

          Here are the gene summaries:


          CASQ2: The protein encoded by this gene specifies the cardiac muscle family member of the calsequestrin family. Calsequestrin is localized to the sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiac and slow skeletal muscle cells. The protein is a calcium binding protein that stores calcium for muscle function. Mutations in this gene cause stress-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, also referred to as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia 2 (CPVT2), a disease characterized by bidirectional ventricular tachycardia that may lead to cardiac arrest. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          TCN1: This gene encodes a member of the vitamin B12-binding protein family. This family of proteins, alternatively referred to as R binders, is expressed in various tissues and secretions. This protein is a major constituent of secondary granules in neutrophils and facilitates the transport of cobalamin into cells. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          INSIG1: This gene encodes an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein that regulates cholesterol metabolism, lipogenesis, and glucose homeostasis. The encoded protein has six transmembrane helices which contain an effector protein binding site. It binds the sterol-sensing domains of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), and is essential for the sterol-mediated trafficking of these two proteins. It promotes the endoplasmic reticulum retention of SCAP and the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2016]

          NFKBIA: This gene encodes a member of the NF-kappa-B inhibitor family, which contain multiple ankrin repeat domains. The encoded protein interacts with REL dimers to inhibit NF-kappa-B/REL complexes which are involved in inflammatory responses. The encoded protein moves between the cytoplasm and the nucleus via a nuclear localization signal and CRM1-mediated nuclear export. Mutations in this gene have been found in ectodermal dysplasia anhidrotic with T-cell immunodeficiency autosomal dominant disease. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]

          ZAR1: This maternal effect gene is oocyte-specific and encodes a protein that is thought to function in the initiation of embryogenesis. A similar protein in mouse is required for female fertility. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]

          TSSC4: This gene is one of several tumor-suppressing subtransferable fragments located in the imprinted gene domain of 11p15.5, an important tumor-suppressor gene region. Alterations in this region have been associated with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, and lung, ovarian, and breast cancer. This gene is located among several imprinted genes; however, this gene, as well as the pan-hematopoietic expression gene (PHEMX), escapes imprinting. This gene may play a role in malignancies and disease that involve this region. Several transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2014]

          XAF1: This gene encodes a protein which binds to and counteracts the inhibitory effect of a member of the IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) protein family. IAP proteins bind to and inhibit caspases which are activated during apoptosis. The proportion of IAPs and proteins which interfere with their activity, such as the encoded protein, affect the progress of the apoptosis signaling pathway. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2012]

          TRIM15: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family. The TRIM motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a RING, a B-box type 1 and a B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region. The protein localizes to the cytoplasm. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described, but their biological validity has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          SEC14L1: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the SEC14 cytosolic factor family. It has similarity to yeast SEC14 and to Japanese flying squid RALBP which suggests a possible role of the gene product in an intracellular transport system.

[provided by RefSeq, Feb 2011]

          TMC8: Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is an autosomal recessive dermatosis characterized by abnormal susceptibility to human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and a high rate of progression to squamous cell carcinoma on sun-exposed skin. EV is caused by mutations in either of two adjacent genes located on chromosome 17q25.3. Both of these genes encode integral membrane proteins that localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and are predicted to form transmembrane channels. This gene encodes a transmembrane channel-like protein with 8 predicted transmembrane domains and 3 leucine zipper motifs. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          STAT3: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the STAT protein family. In response to cytokines and growth factors, STAT family members are phosphorylated by the receptor associated kinases, and then form homo- or heterodimers that translocate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription activators. This protein is activated through phosphorylation in response to various cytokines and growth factors including IFNs, EGF, IL5, IL6, HGF, LIF and BMP2. This protein mediates the expression of a variety of genes in response to cell stimuli, and thus plays a key role in many cellular processes such as cell growth and apoptosis. The small GTPase Rac1 has been shown to bind and regulate the activity of this protein. PIAS3 protein is a specific inhibitor of this protein. This gene also plays a role in regulating host response to viral and bacterial infections. Mutations in this gene are associated with infantile-onset multisystem autoimmune disease and hyper-immunoglobulin E syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2020]

          YWHAZ: This gene product belongs to the 14-3-3 family of proteins which mediate signal transduction by binding to phosphoserine-containing proteins. This highly conserved protein family is found in both plants and mammals, and this protein is 99% identical to the mouse, rat and sheep orthologs. The encoded protein interacts with IRS1 protein, suggesting a role in regulating insulin sensitivity. Several transcript variants that differ in the 5' UTR but that encode the same protein have been identified for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          S100A7: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the S100 family of proteins containing 2 EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. S100 proteins are localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, and involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. S100 genes include at least 13 members which are located as a cluster on chromosome 1q21. This protein differs from the other S100 proteins of known structure in its lack of calcium binding ability in one EF-hand at the N-terminus. The protein is overexpressed in hyperproliferative skin diseases, exhibits antimicrobial activities against bacteria and induces immunomodulatory activities. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]

          PRNP: The protein encoded by this gene is a membrane glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein that tends to aggregate into rod-like structures. The encoded protein contains a highly unstable region of five tandem octapeptide repeats. This gene is found on chromosome 20, approximately 20 kbp upstream of a gene which encodes a biochemically and structurally similar protein to the one encoded by this gene. Mutations in the repeat region as well as elsewhere in this gene have been associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fatal familial insomnia, Gerstmann-Straussler disease, Huntington disease-like 1, and kuru. An overlapping open reading frame has been found for this gene that encodes a smaller, structurally unrelated protein, AltPrp. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]

          LAPTM5: This gene encodes a transmembrane receptor that is associated with lysosomes. The encoded protein, also known as E3 protein, may play a role in hematopoiesis. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2009]

          FTH1: This gene encodes the heavy subunit of ferritin, the major intracellular iron storage protein in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It is composed of 24 subunits of the heavy and light ferritin chains. Variation in ferritin subunit composition may affect the rates of iron uptake and release in different tissues. A major function of ferritin is the storage of iron in a soluble and nontoxic state. Defects in ferritin proteins are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. This gene has multiple pseudogenes. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed, but their biological validity has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          HSPBP1: Enables ubiquitin protein ligase binding activity. Involved in positive regulation of proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process and positive regulation of protein ubiquitination. Predicted to be active in endoplasmic reticulum. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          SESN2: This gene encodes a member of the sestrin family of PA26-related proteins. The encoded protein may function in the regulation of cell growth and survival. This protein may be involved in cellular response to different stress conditions. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

Predicted to be located in cytoplasm. Predicted to be part of polysome. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          GOPC: This gene encodes a Golgi protein with a PDZ domain. The PDZ domain is globular and proteins which contain them bind other proteins through short motifs near the C-termini. Mice which are deficient in the orthologous protein have globozoospermia and are infertile. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]

          PRDX4: The protein encoded by this gene is an antioxidant enzyme and belongs to the peroxiredoxin family. The protein is localized to the cytoplasm. Peroxidases of the peroxiredoxin family reduce hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides to water and alcohol with the use of reducing equivalents derived from thiol-containing donor molecules. This protein has been found to play a regulatory role in the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          LCN2: This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the lipocalin family. Members of this family transport small hydrophobic molecules such as lipids, steroid hormones and retinoids. The protein encoded by this gene is a neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and plays a role in innate immunity by limiting bacterial growth as a result of sequestering iron-containing siderophores. The presence of this protein in blood and urine is an early biomarker of acute kidney injury. This protein is thought to be be involved in multiple cellular processes, including maintenance of skin homeostasis, and suppression of invasiveness and metastasis. Mice lacking this gene are more susceptible to bacterial infection than wild type mice. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]

          C1R: This gene encodes a member of the peptidase S1 protein family. The encoded protein is a proteolytic subunit in the complement system C1 complex. The complement system acts as a mediator in the innate immune response by ultimately triggering phagocytosis, inflammation, and rupturing the bacterial cell wall. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2018]

          INSIG2: The protein encoded by this gene is highly similar to the protein product encoded by gene INSIG1. Both INSIG1 protein and this protein are endoplasmic reticulum proteins that block the processing of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) by binding to SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), and thus prevent SCAP from escorting SREBPs to the Golgi. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          EPN1: This gene encodes a member of the epsin protein family. The encoded protein binds clathrin and is involved in the endocytosis of clathrin-coated vesicles. Loss of function of this gene is associated with reduced tumor growth and progression in certain cancer types. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2016]

          DDX56: This gene encodes a member of the DEAD box protein family. DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. The protein encoded by this gene shows ATPase activity in the presence of polynucleotides and associates with nucleoplasmic 65S preribosomal particles. This gene may be involved in ribosome synthesis, most likely during assembly of the large 60S ribosomal subunit. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012]

          TMC8: Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is an autosomal recessive dermatosis characterized by abnormal susceptibility to human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and a high rate of progression to squamous cell carcinoma on sun-exposed skin. EV is caused by mutations in either of two adjacent genes located on chromosome 17q25.3. Both of these genes encode integral membrane proteins that localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and are predicted to form transmembrane channels. This gene encodes a transmembrane channel-like protein with 8 predicted transmembrane domains and 3 leucine zipper motifs. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          STAT3: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the STAT protein family. In response to cytokines and growth factors, STAT family members are phosphorylated by the receptor associated kinases, and then form homo- or heterodimers that translocate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription activators. This protein is activated through phosphorylation in response to various cytokines and growth factors including IFNs, EGF, IL5, IL6, HGF, LIF and BMP2. This protein mediates the expression of a variety of genes in response to cell stimuli, and thus plays a key role in many cellular processes such as cell growth and apoptosis. The small GTPase Rac1 has been shown to bind and regulate the activity of this protein. PIAS3 protein is a specific inhibitor of this protein. This gene also plays a role in regulating host response to viral and bacterial infections. Mutations in this gene are associated with infantile-onset multisystem autoimmune disease and hyper-immunoglobulin E syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2020]

          YWHAZ: This gene product belongs to the 14-3-3 family of proteins which mediate signal transduction by binding to phosphoserine-containing proteins. This highly conserved protein family is found in both plants and mammals, and this protein is 99% identical to the mouse, rat and sheep orthologs. The encoded protein interacts with IRS1 protein, suggesting a role in regulating insulin sensitivity. Several transcript variants that differ in the 5' UTR but that encode the same protein have been identified for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          S100A7: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the S100 family of proteins containing 2 EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. S100 proteins are localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, and involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. S100 genes include at least 13 members which are located as a cluster on chromosome 1q21. This protein differs from the other S100 proteins of known structure in its lack of calcium binding ability in one EF-hand at the N-terminus. The protein is overexpressed in hyperproliferative skin diseases, exhibits antimicrobial activities against bacteria and induces immunomodulatory activities. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]

          PRNP: The protein encoded by this gene is a membrane glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein that tends to aggregate into rod-like structures. The encoded protein contains a highly unstable region of five tandem octapeptide repeats. This gene is found on chromosome 20, approximately 20 kbp upstream of a gene which encodes a biochemically and structurally similar protein to the one encoded by this gene. Mutations in the repeat region as well as elsewhere in this gene have been associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fatal familial insomnia, Gerstmann-Straussler disease, Huntington disease-like 1, and kuru. An overlapping open reading frame has been found for this gene that encodes a smaller, structurally unrelated protein, AltPrp. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

Mice which are deficient in the orthologous protein have globozoospermia and are infertile. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]

          PRDX4: The protein encoded by this gene is an antioxidant enzyme and belongs to the peroxiredoxin family. The protein is localized to the cytoplasm. Peroxidases of the peroxiredoxin family reduce hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides to water and alcohol with the use of reducing equivalents derived from thiol-containing donor molecules. This protein has been found to play a regulatory role in the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          LCN2: This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the lipocalin family. Members of this family transport small hydrophobic molecules such as lipids, steroid hormones and retinoids. The protein encoded by this gene is a neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and plays a role in innate immunity by limiting bacterial growth as a result of sequestering iron-containing siderophores. The presence of this protein in blood and urine is an early biomarker of acute kidney injury. This protein is thought to be be involved in multiple cellular processes, including maintenance of skin homeostasis, and suppression of invasiveness and metastasis. Mice lacking this gene are more susceptible to bacterial infection than wild type mice. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]

          C1R: This gene encodes a member of the peptidase S1 protein family. The encoded protein is a proteolytic subunit in the complement system C1 complex.

Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2018]

          INSIG2: The protein encoded by this gene is highly similar to the protein product encoded by gene INSIG1. Both INSIG1 protein and this protein are endoplasmic reticulum proteins that block the processing of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) by binding to SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), and thus prevent SCAP from escorting SREBPs to the Golgi. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          EPN1: This gene encodes a member of the epsin protein family. The encoded protein binds clathrin and is involved in the endocytosis of clathrin-coated vesicles. Loss of function of this gene is associated with reduced tumor growth and progression in certain cancer types. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2016]

          DDX56: This gene encodes a member of the DEAD box protein family. DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. The protein encoded by this gene shows ATPase activity in the presence of polynucleotides and associates with nucleoplasmic 65S preribosomal particles. This gene may be involved in ribosome synthesis, most likely during assembly of the large 60S ribosomal subunit. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012]

The specific enrichment of terms related to intracellular transport and regulation of biosynthetic processes suggests that these genes may play a critical role in controlling the flow of molecules and information through the cell, potentially through the formation of protein-containing complexes or other regulatory structures. Additionally, the enrichment of terms related to binding and molecular sequestering activity suggests that some of these genes may also play a role in regulating the availability or activity of certain signaling molecules, either by binding to them directly or by sequestering them away from other cellular components. Together, these mechanisms likely contribute to a complex system of regulatory control that

          Here are the gene summaries:


          CASQ2: The protein encoded by this gene specifies the cardiac muscle family member of the calsequestrin family. Calsequestrin is localized to the sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiac and slow skeletal muscle cells. The protein is a calcium binding protein that stores calcium for muscle function. Mutations in this gene cause stress-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, also referred to as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia 2 (CPVT2), a disease characterized by bidirectional ventricular tachycardia that may lead to cardiac arrest. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          TCN1: This gene encodes a member of the vitamin B12-binding protein family. This family of proteins, alternatively referred to as R binders, is expressed in various tissues and secretions. This protein is a major constituent of secondary granules in neutrophils and facilitates the transport of cobalamin into cells. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          INSIG1: This gene encodes an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein that regulates cholesterol metabolism, lipogenesis, and glucose homeostasis. The encoded protein has six transmembrane helices which contain an effector protein binding site. It binds the sterol-sensing domains of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), and is essential for the sterol-mediated trafficking of these two proteins. It promotes the endoplasmic reticulum retention of SCAP and the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2016]

          NFKBIA: This gene encodes a member of the NF-kappa-B inhibitor family, which contain multiple ankrin repeat domains. The encoded protein interacts with REL dimers to inhibit NF-kappa-B/REL complexes which are involved in inflammatory responses. The encoded protein moves between the cytoplasm and the nucleus via a nuclear localization signal and CRM1-mediated nuclear export. Mutations in this gene have been found in ectodermal dysplasia anhidrotic with T-cell immunodeficiency autosomal dominant disease. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]

          ZAR1: This maternal effect gene is oocyte-specific and encodes a protein that is thought to function in the initiation of embryogenesis. A similar protein in mouse is required for female fertility. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]

          TSSC4: This gene is one of several tumor-suppressing subtransferable fragments located in the imprinted gene domain of 11p15.5, an important tumor-suppressor gene region. Alterations in this region have been associated with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, and lung, ovarian, and breast cancer. This gene is located among several imprinted genes; however, this gene, as well as the pan-hematopoietic expression gene (PHEMX), escapes imprinting. This gene may play a role in malignancies and disease that involve this region. Several transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2014]

          XAF1: This gene encodes a protein which binds to and counteracts the inhibitory effect of a member of the IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) protein family. IAP proteins bind to and inhibit caspases which are activated during apoptosis. The proportion of IAPs and proteins which interfere with their activity, such as the encoded protein, affect the progress of the apoptosis signaling pathway. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2012]

          TRIM15: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family. The TRIM motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a RING, a B-box type 1 and a B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region. The protein localizes to the cytoplasm. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described, but their biological validity has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          SEC14L1: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the SEC14 cytosolic factor family. It has similarity to yeast SEC14 and to Japanese flying squid RALBP which suggests a possible role of the gene product in an intracellular transport system. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene; some variants represent read-through transcripts that include exons from the upstream gene C17orf86. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2011]

          TMC8: Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is an autosomal recessive dermatosis characterized by abnormal susceptibility to human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and a high rate of progression to squamous cell carcinoma on sun-exposed skin. EV is caused by mutations in either of two adjacent genes located on chromosome 17q25.3. Both of these genes encode integral membrane proteins that localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and are predicted to form transmembrane channels. This gene encodes a transmembrane channel-like protein with 8 predicted transmembrane domains and 3 leucine zipper motifs. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          STAT3: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the STAT protein family. In response to cytokines and growth factors, STAT family members are phosphorylated by the receptor associated kinases, and then form homo- or heterodimers that translocate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription activators. This protein is activated through phosphorylation in response to various cytokines and growth factors including IFNs, EGF, IL5, IL6, HGF, LIF and BMP2. This protein mediates the expression of a variety of genes in response to cell stimuli, and thus plays a key role in many cellular processes such as cell growth and apoptosis. The small GTPase Rac1 has been shown to bind and regulate the activity of this protein. PIAS3 protein is a specific inhibitor of this protein. This gene also plays a role in regulating host response to viral and bacterial infections. Mutations in this gene are associated with infantile-onset multisystem autoimmune disease and hyper-immunoglobulin E syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2020]

          YWHAZ: This gene product belongs to the 14-3-3 family of proteins which mediate signal transduction by binding to phosphoserine-containing proteins. This highly conserved protein family is found in both plants and mammals, and this protein is 99% identical to the mouse, rat and sheep orthologs. The encoded protein interacts with IRS1 protein, suggesting a role in regulating insulin sensitivity. Several transcript variants that differ in the 5' UTR but that encode the same protein have been identified for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          S100A7: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the S100 family of proteins containing 2 EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. S100 proteins are localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, and involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. S100 genes include at least 13 members which are located as a cluster on chromosome 1q21. This protein differs from the other S100 proteins of known structure in its lack of calcium binding ability in one EF-hand at the N-terminus. The protein is overexpressed in hyperproliferative skin diseases, exhibits antimicrobial activities against bacteria and induces immunomodulatory activities. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]

          PRNP: The protein encoded by this gene is a membrane glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein that tends to aggregate into rod-like structures. The encoded protein contains a highly unstable region of five tandem octapeptide repeats. This gene is found on chromosome 20, approximately 20 kbp upstream of a gene which encodes a biochemically and structurally similar protein to the one encoded by this gene. Mutations in the repeat region as well as elsewhere in this gene have been associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fatal familial insomnia, Gerstmann-Straussler disease, Huntington disease-like 1, and kuru. An overlapping open reading frame has been found for this gene that encodes a smaller, structurally unrelated protein, AltPrp. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]

          LAPTM5: This gene encodes a transmembrane receptor that is associated with lysosomes. The encoded protein, also known as E3 protein, may play a role in hematopoiesis. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2009]

          CASTOR1: Enables arginine binding activity and identical protein binding activity. Involved in cellular response to L-arginine and negative regulation of TORC1 signaling. Located in cytosol. Colocalizes with GATOR2 complex. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          FTH1: This gene encodes the heavy subunit of ferritin, the major intracellular iron storage protein in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It is composed of 24 subunits of the heavy and light ferritin chains. Variation in ferritin subunit composition may affect the rates of iron uptake and release in different tissues. A major function of ferritin is the storage of iron in a soluble and nontoxic state. Defects in ferritin proteins are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. This gene has multiple pseudogenes. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed, but their biological validity has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          HSPBP1: Enables ubiquitin protein ligase binding activity. Involved in positive regulation of proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process and positive regulation of protein ubiquitination. Predicted to be active in endoplasmic reticulum. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          SESN2: This gene encodes a member of the sestrin family of PA26-related proteins. The encoded protein may function in the regulation of cell growth and survival. This protein may be involved in cellular response to different stress conditions. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          IMPACT: Predicted to enable actin binding activity and ribosome binding activity. Predicted to be involved in several processes, including GCN2-mediated signaling; cellular response to starvation; and negative regulation of nitrogen compound metabolic process. Predicted to be located in cytoplasm. Predicted to be part of polysome. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          GOPC: This gene encodes a Golgi protein with a PDZ domain. The PDZ domain is globular and proteins which contain them bind other proteins through short motifs near the C-termini. Mice which are deficient in the orthologous protein have globozoospermia and are infertile. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]

          PRDX4: The protein encoded by this gene is an antioxidant enzyme and belongs to the peroxiredoxin family. The protein is localized to the cytoplasm. Peroxidases of the peroxiredoxin family reduce hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides to water and alcohol with the use of reducing equivalents derived from thiol-containing donor molecules. This protein has been found to play a regulatory role in the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          LCN2: This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the lipocalin family. Members of this family transport small hydrophobic molecules such as lipids, steroid hormones and retinoids. The protein encoded by this gene is a neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and plays a role in innate immunity by limiting bacterial growth as a result of sequestering iron-containing siderophores. The presence of this protein in blood and urine is an early biomarker of acute kidney injury. This protein is thought to be be involved in multiple cellular processes, including maintenance of skin homeostasis, and suppression of invasiveness and metastasis. Mice lacking this gene are more susceptible to bacterial infection than wild type mice. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]

          C1R: This gene encodes a member of the peptidase S1 protein family. The encoded protein is a proteolytic subunit in the complement system C1 complex. The complement system acts as a mediator in the innate immune response by ultimately triggering phagocytosis, inflammation, and rupturing the bacterial cell wall. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2018]

          INSIG2: The protein encoded by this gene is highly similar to the protein product encoded by gene INSIG1. Both INSIG1 protein and this protein are endoplasmic reticulum proteins that block the processing of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) by binding to SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), and thus prevent SCAP from escorting SREBPs to the Golgi. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          EPN1: This gene encodes a member of the epsin protein family. The encoded protein binds clathrin and is involved in the endocytosis of clathrin-coated vesicles. Loss of function of this gene is associated with reduced tumor growth and progression in certain cancer types. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2016]

          DDX56: This gene encodes a member of the DEAD box protein family. DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. The protein encoded by this gene shows ATPase activity in the presence of polynucleotides and associates with nucleoplasmic 65S preribosomal particles. This gene may be involved in ribosome synthesis, most likely during assembly of the large 60S ribosomal subunit. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012]

          Here are the gene summaries:


          CASQ2: The protein encoded by this gene specifies the cardiac muscle family member of the calsequestrin family. Calsequestrin is localized to the sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiac and slow skeletal muscle cells. The protein is a calcium binding protein that stores calcium for muscle function. Mutations in this gene cause stress-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, also referred to as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia 2 (CPVT2), a disease characterized by bidirectional ventricular tachycardia that may lead to cardiac arrest. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          TCN1: This gene encodes a member of the vitamin B12-binding protein family. This family of proteins, alternatively referred to as R binders, is expressed in various tissues and secretions. This protein is a major constituent of secondary granules in neutrophils and facilitates the transport of cobalamin into cells. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          INSIG1: This gene encodes an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein that regulates cholesterol metabolism, lipogenesis, and glucose homeostasis. The encoded protein has six transmembrane helices which contain an effector protein binding site. It binds the sterol-sensing domains of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), and is essential for the sterol-mediated trafficking of these two proteins. It promotes the endoplasmic reticulum retention of SCAP and the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2016]

          NFKBIA: This gene encodes a member of the NF-kappa-B inhibitor family, which contain multiple ankrin repeat domains. The encoded protein interacts with REL dimers to inhibit NF-kappa-B/REL complexes which are involved in inflammatory responses. The encoded protein moves between the cytoplasm and the nucleus via a nuclear localization signal and CRM1-mediated nuclear export. Mutations in this gene have been found in ectodermal dysplasia anhidrotic with T-cell immunodeficiency autosomal dominant disease. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]

          ZAR1: This maternal effect gene is oocyte-specific and encodes a protein that is thought to function in the initiation of embryogenesis. A similar protein in mouse is required for female fertility. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]

          TSSC4: This gene is one of several tumor-suppressing subtransferable fragments located in the imprinted gene domain of 11p15.5, an important tumor-suppressor gene region. Alterations in this region have been associated with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, and lung, ovarian, and breast cancer. This gene is located among several imprinted genes; however, this gene, as well as the pan-hematopoietic expression gene (PHEMX), escapes imprinting. This gene may play a role in malignancies and disease that involve this region. Several transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2014]

          XAF1: This gene encodes a protein which binds to and counteracts the inhibitory effect of a member of the IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) protein family. IAP proteins bind to and inhibit caspases which are activated during apoptosis. The proportion of IAPs and proteins which interfere with their activity, such as the encoded protein, affect the progress of the apoptosis signaling pathway. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2012]

          TRIM15: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family. The TRIM motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a RING, a B-box type 1 and a B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region. The protein localizes to the cytoplasm. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described, but their biological validity has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          SEC14L1: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the SEC14 cytosolic factor family. It has similarity to yeast SEC14 and to Japanese flying squid RALBP which suggests a possible role of the gene product in an intracellular transport system. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene; some variants represent read-through transcripts that include exons from the upstream gene C17orf86. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2011]

          TMC8: Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is an autosomal recessive dermatosis characterized by abnormal susceptibility to human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and a high rate of progression to squamous cell carcinoma on sun-exposed skin. EV is caused by mutations in either of two adjacent genes located on chromosome 17q25.3. Both of these genes encode integral membrane proteins that localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and are predicted to form transmembrane channels. This gene encodes a transmembrane channel-like protein with 8 predicted transmembrane domains and 3 leucine zipper motifs. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          STAT3: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the STAT protein family. In response to cytokines and growth factors, STAT family members are phosphorylated by the receptor associated kinases, and then form homo- or heterodimers that translocate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription activators. This protein is activated through phosphorylation in response to various cytokines and growth factors including IFNs, EGF, IL5, IL6, HGF, LIF and BMP2. This protein mediates the expression of a variety of genes in response to cell stimuli, and thus plays a key role in many cellular processes such as cell growth and apoptosis. The small GTPase Rac1 has been shown to bind and regulate the activity of this protein. PIAS3 protein is a specific inhibitor of this protein. This gene also plays a role in regulating host response to viral and bacterial infections. Mutations in this gene are associated with infantile-onset multisystem autoimmune disease and hyper-immunoglobulin E syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2020]

          YWHAZ: This gene product belongs to the 14-3-3 family of proteins which mediate signal transduction by binding to phosphoserine-containing proteins. This highly conserved protein family is found in both plants and mammals, and this protein is 99% identical to the mouse, rat and sheep orthologs. The encoded protein interacts with IRS1 protein, suggesting a role in regulating insulin sensitivity. Several transcript variants that differ in the 5' UTR but that encode the same protein have been identified for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          S100A7: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the S100 family of proteins containing 2 EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. S100 proteins are localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, and involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. S100 genes include at least 13 members which are located as a cluster on chromosome 1q21. This protein differs from the other S100 proteins of known structure in its lack of calcium binding ability in one EF-hand at the N-terminus. The protein is overexpressed in hyperproliferative skin diseases, exhibits antimicrobial activities against bacteria and induces immunomodulatory activities. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]

          PRNP: The protein encoded by this gene is a membrane glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein that tends to aggregate into rod-like structures. The encoded protein contains a highly unstable region of five tandem octapeptide repeats. This gene is found on chromosome 20, approximately 20 kbp upstream of a gene which encodes a biochemically and structurally similar protein to the one encoded by this gene. Mutations in the repeat region as well as elsewhere in this gene have been associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fatal familial insomnia, Gerstmann-Straussler disease, Huntington disease-like 1, and kuru. An overlapping open reading frame has been found for this gene that encodes a smaller, structurally unrelated protein, AltPrp. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]

          LAPTM5: This gene encodes a transmembrane receptor that is associated with lysosomes. The encoded protein, also known as E3 protein, may play a role in hematopoiesis. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2009]

          CASTOR1: Enables arginine binding activity and identical protein binding activity. Involved in cellular response to L-arginine and negative regulation of TORC1 signaling. Located in cytosol. Colocalizes with GATOR2 complex. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          FTH1: This gene encodes the heavy subunit of ferritin, the major intracellular iron storage protein in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It is composed of 24 subunits of the heavy and light ferritin chains. Variation in ferritin subunit composition may affect the rates of iron uptake and release in different tissues. A major function of ferritin is the storage of iron in a soluble and nontoxic state. Defects in ferritin proteins are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. This gene has multiple pseudogenes. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed, but their biological validity has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          HSPBP1: Enables ubiquitin protein ligase binding activity. Involved in positive regulation of proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process and positive regulation of protein ubiquitination. Predicted to be active in endoplasmic reticulum. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          SESN2: This gene encodes a member of the sestrin family of PA26-related proteins. The encoded protein may function in the regulation of cell growth and survival. This protein may be involved in cellular response to different stress conditions. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          IMPACT: Predicted to enable actin binding activity and ribosome binding activity. Predicted to be involved in several processes, including GCN2-mediated signaling; cellular response to starvation; and negative regulation of nitrogen compound metabolic process. Predicted to be located in cytoplasm. Predicted to be part of polysome. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          GOPC: This gene encodes a Golgi protein with a PDZ domain. The PDZ domain is globular and proteins which contain them bind other proteins through short motifs near the C-termini. Mice which are deficient in the orthologous protein have globozoospermia and are infertile. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]

          PRDX4: The protein encoded by this gene is an antioxidant enzyme and belongs to the peroxiredoxin family. The protein is localized to the cytoplasm. Peroxidases of the peroxiredoxin family reduce hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides to water and alcohol with the use of reducing equivalents derived from thiol-containing donor molecules. This protein has been found to play a regulatory role in the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          LCN2: This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the lipocalin family. Members of this family transport small hydrophobic molecules such as lipids, steroid hormones and retinoids. The protein encoded by this gene is a neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and plays a role in innate immunity by limiting bacterial growth as a result of sequestering iron-containing siderophores. The presence of this protein in blood and urine is an early biomarker of acute kidney injury. This protein is thought to be be involved in multiple cellular processes, including maintenance of skin homeostasis, and suppression of invasiveness and metastasis. Mice lacking this gene are more susceptible to bacterial infection than wild type mice. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]

          C1R: This gene encodes a member of the peptidase S1 protein family. The encoded protein is a proteolytic subunit in the complement system C1 complex. The complement system acts as a mediator in the innate immune response by ultimately triggering phagocytosis, inflammation, and rupturing the bacterial cell wall. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2018]

          INSIG2: The protein encoded by this gene is highly similar to the protein product encoded by gene INSIG1. Both INSIG1 protein and this protein are endoplasmic reticulum proteins that block the processing of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) by binding to SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), and thus prevent SCAP from escorting SREBPs to the Golgi. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          EPN1: This gene encodes a member of the epsin protein family. The encoded protein binds clathrin and is involved in the endocytosis of clathrin-coated vesicles. Loss of function of this gene is associated with reduced tumor growth and progression in certain cancer types. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2016]

          DDX56: This gene encodes a member of the DEAD box protein family. DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. The protein encoded by this gene shows ATPase activity in the presence of polynucleotides and associates with nucleoplasmic 65S preribosomal particles. This gene may be involved in ribosome synthesis, most likely during assembly of the large 60S ribosomal subunit. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012]

          CASQ2: The protein encoded by this gene specifies the cardiac muscle family member of the calsequestrin family. Calsequestrin is localized to the sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiac and slow skeletal muscle cells. The protein is a calcium binding protein that stores calcium for muscle function. Mutations in this gene cause stress-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, also referred to as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia 2 (CPVT2), a disease characterized by bidirectional ventricular tachycardia that may lead to cardiac arrest.
