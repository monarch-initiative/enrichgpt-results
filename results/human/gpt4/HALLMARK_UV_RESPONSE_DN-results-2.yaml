          Summary: Extracellular matrix structural constituent, growth factor binding, protein kinase activity, nucleotide binding, transcription factor activity, protein binding.

          Enriched Terms: Extracellular matrix organization; growth factor signaling; regulation of transcription, DNA-templated; positive regulation of protein kinase activity; organic acid metabolic process.

          Mechanism: These genes are involved in extracellular matrix structural constituent, growth factor signaling, transcription factor activity, protein binding, and nucleotide binding. This suggests that they may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, cellular growth and differentiation, and the organization of extracellular matrices. A hypothesis for the underlying biological mechanism or pathway is that these genes may be involved in the regulation of extracellular matrix formation and growth factor signaling pathways, which then contribute to cellular differentiation and growth. Additionally, the binding of proteins with transcription factor activity and nucleotide binding activity suggests that these genes are involved in the regulation of gene transcription, which may have downstream effects on cellular function and behavior.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          Provide results in the format

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          I will give you a list of human genes .
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          Hypothesis: These genes encode proteins related to the extracellular matrix (ECM) integrity and signaling pathways. The ECM is a complex network made of collagen, proteoglycans, and other glycoproteins that holds the cells and tissues together. The term extracellular matrix organization, cell-matrix adhesion, and negative regulation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway are over-represented, indicating that these genes likely provide structural stability to the ECM and prevent tumor growth and invasion.

          Positive regulation of cell migration might be related to cellular responses during tissue repair, while negative regulation of mitotic cell cycle phase transition may play a role in preventing tumorigenesis. Adipose tissue development is an interesting finding. It could suggest that these genes have a role in metabolic processes and lipid storage or release. Protein kinase B (AK

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          Provide results in the format

          Summary: <high level summary>
          Mechanism: <mechanism>
          Enriched Terms: <term1>; <term2>; <term3>

          For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number the list.
          Always put the list of terms last, after mechanism, summary, or hypotheses.

          Summary: Extracellular matrix organization and cell adhesion
          Enriched Terms: Basement membrane organization; Collagen fibril organization; Extracellular matrix organization; Cell adhesion

          Mechanism: These genes are involved in maintaining the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell adhesion. Basement membrane organization, collagen fibril organization and extracellular matrix organization all involve the formation and maintenance of ECM. Cell adhesion is the process by which cells attach to each other and/or the ECM. 

          Hypothesis: The ECM is a complex network of proteins that provides structural support and signaling cues to cells. Disruption of ECM organization and cell adhesion can lead to a variety of diseases, including cancer and connective tissue disorders. The enrichment of these terms suggests that the genes listed play a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the ECM and regulating cell adhesion, and may be potential targets for therapeutic intervention in ECM-related diseases.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          The genes are enriched for molecular functions that control cellular processes such as signal transduction, extracellular matrix structural constituents, ligand binding, DNA and mRNA binding and transcription, and enzyme regulation and activity.

          Mechanism: The human genes are involved in a variety of processes and pathways, including signal transduction, transcription, extracellular matrix structural constituents, ligand binding, and enzyme regulation and activity. These processes and pathways are regulated by a combination of intra- and extracellular signals, which serve to propagate and amplify the functions of the genes to control a range of cellular processes.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

           This list of genes is associated with numerous cellular activities such as DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA binding activity, enzyme binding activity, cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor activity, ion transporter activity, protein kinase activity, and signaling receptor activity. From an enrichment test, it appears that commonalities of the gene functions have to do with signal transduction and cell-cell communication, such as cell growth, development and differentiation, and generation of cell responses. The underlying biological mechanism could be related to the integration of signal transduction pathways, activating or repressing gene transcription in response to a variety of physiological and environmental triggers.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.
