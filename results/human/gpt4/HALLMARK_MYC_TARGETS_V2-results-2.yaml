        Here are the gene summaries:



        AIMP2: The protein encoded by this gene is part of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
        complex, which contains nine different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and three
        non-enzymatic factors. The encoded protein is one of the non-enzymatic factors
        and is required for assembly and stability of the complex. [provided by RefSeq,
        May 2016]


        BYSL: Bystin is expressed as a 2-kb major transcript and a 3.6-kb minor transcript
        in SNG-M cells and in human trophoblastic teratocarcinoma HT-H cells. Protein
        binding assays determined that bystin binds directly to trophinin and tastin,
        and that binding is enhanced when cytokeratins 8 and 18 are present. Immunocytochemistry
        of HT-H cells showed that bystin colocalizes with trophinin, tastin, and the
        cytokeratins, suggesting that these molecules form a complex in trophectoderm
        cells at the time of implantation. Using immunohistochemistry it was determined
        that trophinin and bystin are found in the placenta from the sixth week of
        pregnancy. Both proteins were localized in the cytoplasm of the syncytiotrophoblast
        in the chorionic villi and in endometrial decidual cells at the uteroplacental
        interface. After week 10, the levels of trophinin, tastin, and bystin decreased
        and then disappeared from placental villi. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        CBX3: At the nuclear envelope, the nuclear lamina and heterochromatin are
        adjacent to the inner nuclear membrane. The protein encoded by this gene binds
        DNA and is a component of heterochromatin. This protein also can bind lamin
        B receptor, an integral membrane protein found in the inner nuclear membrane.
        The dual binding functions of the encoded protein may explain the association
        of heterochromatin with the inner nuclear membrane. This protein binds histone
        H3 tails methylated at Lys-9 sites. This protein is also recruited to sites
        of ultraviolet-induced DNA damage and double-strand breaks. Two transcript
        variants encoding the same protein but differing in the 5'' UTR, have been
        found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2011]


        CDK4: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Ser/Thr protein
        kinase family. This protein is highly similar to the gene products of S. cerevisiae
        cdc28 and S. pombe cdc2. It is a catalytic subunit of the protein kinase complex
        that is important for cell cycle G1 phase progression. The activity of this
        kinase is restricted to the G1-S phase, which is controlled by the regulatory
        subunits D-type cyclins and CDK inhibitor p16(INK4a). This kinase was shown
        to be responsible for the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma gene product (Rb).
        Mutations in this gene as well as in its related proteins including D-type
        cyclins, p16(INK4a) and Rb were all found to be associated with tumorigenesis
        of a variety of cancers. Multiple polyadenylation sites of this gene have
        been reported. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        DCTPP1: The protein encoded by this gene is dCTP pyrophosphatase, which converts
        dCTP to dCMP and inorganic pyrophosphate. The encoded protein also displays
        weak activity against dTTP and dATP, but none against dGTP. This protein may
        be responsible for eliminating excess dCTP after DNA synthesis and may prevent
        overmethylation of CpG islands. Three transcript variants, one protein-coding
        and the other two non-protein coding, have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Dec 2015]


        DDX18: DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp
        (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular
        processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation
        initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome
        assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family
        are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular
        growth and division. This gene encodes a DEAD box protein, and it is activated
        by Myc protein. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        DUSP2: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the dual specificity
        protein phosphatase subfamily.  These phosphatases inactivate their target
        kinases by dephosphorylating both the phosphoserine/threonine and phosphotyrosine
        residues.  They negatively regulate members of the mitogen-activated protein
        (MAP) kinase superfamily (MAPK/ERK, SAPK/JNK, p38), which are associated with
        cellular proliferation and differentiation.  Different members of the family
        of dual specificity phosphatases show distinct substrate specificities for
        various MAP kinases, different tissue distribution and subcellular localization,
        and different modes of inducibility of their expression by extracellular stimuli.  This
        gene product inactivates ERK1 and ERK2, is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic
        tissues, and is localized in the nucleus. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        EXOSC5: Predicted to enable RNA binding activity. Involved in DNA deamination
        and exonucleolytic catabolism of deadenylated mRNA. Acts upstream of or within
        defense response to virus. Located in nucleolus; nucleoplasm; and transcriptionally
        active chromatin. Part of exosome (RNase complex). [provided by Alliance of
        Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        FARSA: Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are a class of enzymes that charge tRNAs
        with their cognate amino acids. This gene encodes a product which is similar
        to the catalytic subunit of prokaryotic and Saccharomyces cerevisiae phenylalanyl-tRNA
        synthetases (PheRS). This gene product has been shown to be expressed in a
        tumor-selective and cell cycle stage- and differentiation-dependent manner,
        the first member of the tRNA synthetase gene family shown to exhibit this
        type of regulated expression [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        GNL3: The protein encoded by this gene may interact with p53 and may be involved
        in tumorigenesis. The encoded protein also appears to be important for stem
        cell proliferation. This protein is found in both the nucleus and nucleolus.
        Three transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found
        for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010]


        GRWD1: This gene encodes a glutamate-rich protein that contains five WD-repeat
        motifs. The encoded protein may play a critical role in ribosome biogenesis
        and may also play a role in histone methylation through interactions with
        CUL4-DDB1 ubiquitin E3 ligase. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2012]


        HK2: Hexokinases phosphorylate glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate, the
        first step in most glucose metabolism pathways. This gene encodes hexokinase
        2, the predominant form found in skeletal muscle. It localizes to the outer
        membrane of mitochondria. Expression of this gene is insulin-responsive, and
        studies in rat suggest that it is involved in the increased rate of glycolysis
        seen in rapidly growing cancer cells. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2009]


        HSPD1: This gene encodes a member of the chaperonin family. The encoded mitochondrial
        protein may function as a signaling molecule in the innate immune system.
        This protein is essential for the folding and assembly of newly imported proteins
        in the mitochondria. This gene is adjacent to a related family member and
        the region between the 2 genes functions as a bidirectional promoter. Several
        pseudogenes have been associated with this gene. Two transcript variants encoding
        the same protein have been identified for this gene. Mutations associated
        with this gene cause autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia 13. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jun 2010]


        HSPE1: This gene encodes a major heat shock protein which functions as a chaperonin.
        Its structure consists of a heptameric ring which binds to another heat shock
        protein in order to form a symmetric, functional heterodimer which enhances
        protein folding in an ATP-dependent manner. This gene and its co-chaperonin,
        HSPD1, are arranged in a head-to-head orientation on chromosome 2. Naturally
        occurring read-through transcription occurs between this locus and the neighboring
        locus MOBKL3.[provided by RefSeq, Feb 2011]


        IMP4: The protein encoded by this gene, along with IMP3 and MPP10, is part
        of the 60-80S U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (U3 snoRNP) complex. This
        complex is necessary for the early cleavage steps of pre-18S ribosomal RNA
        processing. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been
        found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        IPO4: Predicted to enable nuclear import signal receptor activity and nuclear
        localization sequence binding activity. Involved in DNA replication-dependent
        chromatin assembly; DNA replication-independent chromatin assembly; and protein
        import into nucleus. Located in chromatin. Part of protein-containing complex.
        [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        LAS1L: Enables RNA binding activity. Predicted to be involved in maturation
        of 5.8S rRNA and maturation of LSU-rRNA. Located in membrane. Part of MLL1
        complex. Implicated in Wilson-Turner syndrome. [provided by Alliance of Genome
        Resources, Apr 2022]


        MAP3K6: This gene encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that forms a component
        of protein kinase-mediated signal transduction cascades. The encoded kinase
        participates in the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
        expression. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
        [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2014]


        MCM4: The protein encoded by this gene is one of the highly conserved mini-chromosome
        maintenance proteins (MCM) that are essential for the initiation of eukaryotic
        genome replication. The hexameric protein complex formed by MCM proteins is
        a key component of the pre-replication complex (pre_RC) and may be involved
        in the formation of replication forks and in the recruitment of other DNA
        replication related proteins. The MCM complex consisting of this protein and
        MCM2, 6 and 7 proteins possesses DNA helicase activity, and may act as a DNA
        unwinding enzyme. The phosphorylation of this protein by CDC2 kinase reduces
        the DNA helicase activity and chromatin binding of the MCM complex. This gene
        is mapped to a region on the chromosome 8 head-to-head next to the PRKDC/DNA-PK,
        a DNA-activated protein kinase involved in the repair of DNA double-strand
        breaks. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein
        have been reported. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        MCM5: The protein encoded by this gene is structurally very similar to the
        CDC46 protein from S. cerevisiae, a protein involved in the initiation of
        DNA replication. The encoded protein is a member of the MCM family of chromatin-binding
        proteins and can interact with at least two other members of this family.
        The encoded protein is upregulated in the transition from the G0 to G1/S phase
        of the cell cycle and may actively participate in cell cycle regulation. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        MPHOSPH10: This gene encodes a protein that is phosphorylated during mitosis.
        The protein localizes to the nucleolus during interphase and to the chromosomes
        during M phase. The protein associates with the U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein
        60-80S complexes and may be involved in pre-rRNA processing. [provided by
        RefSeq, Dec 2010]


        MRTO4: This gene encodes a protein sharing a low level of sequence similarity
        with ribosomal protein P0. While the precise function of the encoded protein
        is currently unknown, it appears to be involved in mRNA turnover and ribosome
        assembly. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        MYBBP1A: This gene encodes a nucleolar transcriptional regulator that was
        first identified by its ability to bind specifically to the Myb proto-oncogene
        protein. The encoded protein is thought to play a role in many cellular processes
        including response to nucleolar stress, tumor suppression and synthesis of
        ribosomal DNA. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
        [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]


        MYC: This gene is a proto-oncogene and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that
        plays a role in cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cellular transformation.
        The encoded protein forms a heterodimer with the related transcription factor
        MAX. This complex binds to the E box DNA consensus sequence and regulates
        the transcription of specific target genes. Amplification of this gene is
        frequently observed in numerous human cancers. Translocations involving this
        gene are associated with Burkitt lymphoma and multiple myeloma in human patients.
        There is evidence to show that translation initiates both from an upstream,
        in-frame non-AUG (CUG) and a downstream AUG start site, resulting in the production
        of two isoforms with distinct N-termini. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        NDUFAF4: NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) catalyzes the transfer
        of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) in the first step of the
        mitochondrial respiratory chain, resulting in the translocation of protons
        across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This gene encodes a complex I assembly
        factor. Mutations in this gene are a cause of mitochondrial complex I deficiency.

        formation; and regulation of translation. Located in fibrillar center. [provided
        by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        NOP16: This gene encodes a protein that is localized to the nucleolus. Expression
        of this gene is induced by estrogens and Myc protein and is a marker of poor
        patient survival in breast cancer. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2015]


        NOP2: Enables RNA binding activity. Involved in positive regulation of cell
        population proliferation; regulation of signal transduction by p53 class mediator;
        and ribosomal large subunit assembly. Located in nucleolus. [provided by Alliance
        of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        NOP56: Nop56p is a yeast nucleolar protein that is part of a complex with
        the nucleolar proteins Nop58p and fibrillarin. Nop56p is required for assembly
        of the 60S ribosomal subunit and is involved in pre-rRNA processing. The protein
        encoded by this gene is similar in sequence to Nop56p and is also found in
        the nucleolus. Expansion of a GGCCTG repeat from 3-8 copies to 1500-2500 copies
        in an intron of this gene results in spinocerebellar ataxia 36. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding several different isoforms have been found for this gene,
        but the full-length nature of most of them has not been determined. [provided

        NPM1: The protein encoded by this gene is involved in several cellular processes,
        including centrosome duplication, protein chaperoning, and cell proliferation.
        The encoded phosphoprotein shuttles between the nucleolus, nucleus, and cytoplasm,
        chaperoning ribosomal proteins and core histones from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
        This protein is also known to sequester the tumor suppressor ARF in the nucleolus,
        protecting it from degradation until it is needed. Mutations in this gene
        are associated with acute myeloid leukemia. Dozens of pseudogenes of this
        gene have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        PA2G4: This gene encodes an RNA-binding protein that is involved in growth
        regulation. This protein is present in pre-ribosomal ribonucleoprotein complexes
        and may be involved in ribosome assembly and the regulation of intermediate
        and late steps of rRNA processing. This protein can interact with the cytoplasmic
        domain of the ErbB3 receptor and may contribute to transducing growth regulatory
        signals. This protein is also a transcriptional co-repressor of androgen receptor-regulated
        genes and other cell cycle regulatory genes through its interactions with
        histone deacetylases. This protein has been implicated in growth inhibition
        and the induction of differentiation of human cancer cells. Six pseudogenes,
        located on chromosomes 3, 6, 9, 18, 20 and X, have been identified. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PES1: This gene encodes a nuclear protein that contains a breast cancer associated
        gene 1 (BRCA1) C-terminal interaction domain. The encoded protein interacts
        with BOP1 and WDR12 to form the PeBoW complex, which plays a critical role
        in cell proliferation via pre-rRNA processing and 60S ribosomal subunit maturation.
        Expression of this gene may play an important role in breast cancer proliferation
        and tumorigenicity. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple
        isoforms have been observed for this gene. Pseudogenes of this gene are located
        on the long arm of chromosome 4 and the short arm of chromosome 9. [provided
        by RefSeq, Aug 2011]


        PHB1: This gene is evolutionarily conserved, and its product is proposed to
        play a role in human cellular senescence and tumor suppression. Antiproliferative
        activity is reported to be localized to the 3'' UTR, which is proposed to
        function as a trans-acting regulatory RNA. Several pseudogenes of this gene
        have been identified. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]


        PLK1: The Ser/Thr protein kinase encoded by this gene belongs to the CDC5/Polo
        subfamily. It is highly expressed during mitosis and elevated levels are found
        in many different types of cancer. Depletion of this protein in cancer cells
        dramatically inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis; hence, it
        is a target for cancer therapy. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]


        PLK4: This gene encodes a member of the polo family of serine/threonine protein
        kinases. The protein localizes to centrioles, complex microtubule-based structures
        found in centrosomes, and regulates centriole duplication during the cell
        cycle. Three alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different
        protein isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2010]


        PPAN: The protein encoded by this gene is an evolutionarily conserved protein
        similar to yeast SSF1 as well as to the gene product of the Drosophila gene
        peter pan (ppan). SSF1 is known to be involved in the second step of mRNA
        splicing. Both SSF1 and ppan are essential for cell growth and proliferation.
        Exogenous expression of this gene was reported to reduce the anchorage-independent
        growth of some tumor cells. Read-through transcription of this gene with P2RY11/P2Y(11),
        an adjacent downstream gene that encodes an ATP receptor, has been found.
        These read-through transcripts are ubiquitously present and up-regulated during
        granulocyte differentiation. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010]


        PPRC1: The protein encoded by this gene is similar to PPAR-gamma coactivator
        1 (PPARGC1/PGC-1), a protein that can activate mitochondrial biogenesis in
        part through a direct interaction with nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1).
        This protein has been shown to interact with NRF1. It is thought to be a functional
        relative of PPAR-gamma coactivator 1 that activates mitochondrial biogenesis
        through NRF1 in response to proliferative signals. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2013]


        PRMT3: This gene belongs to the protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT)
        family. The encoded enzyme catalyzes the methylation of guanidino nitrogens
        of arginyl residues of proteins. The enzyme acts on 40S ribosomal protein
        S2 (rpS2), which is its major in-vivo substrate, and is involved in the proper
        maturation of the 80S ribosome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2013]


        PUS1: This gene encodes a pseudouridine synthase that converts uridine to
        pseudouridine once it has been incorporated into an RNA molecule. The encoded
        enzyme may play an essential role in tRNA function and in stabilizing the
        secondary and tertiary structure of many RNAs. A mutation in this gene has
        been linked to mitochondrial myopathy and sideroblastic anemia. Alternate
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Sep
        2009]

        in endonucleolytic cleavage of tricistronic rRNA transcript (SSU-rRNA, 5.8S
        rRNA, LSU-rRNA). Predicted to act upstream of or within endonucleolytic cleavage
        in 5''-ETS of tricistronic rRNA transcript (SSU-rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, LSU-rRNA)
        and endonucleolytic cleavage in ITS1 to separate SSU-rRNA from 5.8S rRNA and
        LSU-rRNA from tricistronic rRNA transcript (SSU-rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, LSU-rRNA).
        Predicted to be located in nucleoplasm. Predicted to be active in nucleolus.

        Located in cytosol; nucleolus; and plasma membrane. [provided by Alliance
        of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        RRP9: This gene encodes a member of the WD-repeat protein family. The encoded
        protein is a component of the nucleolar small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle
        (snoRNP) and is essential for 18s rRNA processing during ribosome synthesis.
        It contains seven WD domains required for nucleolar localization and specific
        interaction with the U3 small nucleolar RNA (U3 snoRNA). [provided by RefSeq,
        Oct 2012]


        SLC19A1: The membrane protein encoded by this gene is a transporter of folate
        and is involved in the regulation of intracellular concentrations of folate.
        Three transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for
        this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2011]


        SLC29A2: The uptake of nucleosides by transporters, such as SLC29A2, is essential
        for nucleotide synthesis by salvage pathways in cells that lack de novo biosynthetic
        pathways. Nucleoside transport also plays a key role in the regulation of
        many physiologic processes through its effect on adenosine concentration at
        the cell surface (Griffiths et al., 1997 [PubMed 9396714]).[supplied by OMIM,
        Nov 2008]


        SORD: Sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD; EC 1.1.1.14) catalyzes the interconversion
        of polyols and their corresponding ketoses, and together with aldose reductase
        (ALDR1; MIM 103880), makes up the sorbitol pathway that is believed to play
        an important role in the development of diabetic complications (summarized
        by Carr and Markham, 1995 [PubMed 8535074]). The first reaction of the pathway
        (also called the polyol pathway) is the reduction of glucose to sorbitol by
        ALDR1 with NADPH as the cofactor. SORD then oxidizes the sorbitol to fructose
        using NAD(+) cofactor.[supplied by OMIM, Jul 2010]


        SRM: The polyamines putrescine, spermine, and spermidine are ubiquitous polycationic
        mediators of cell growth and differentiation. Spermidine synthase is one of
        four enzymes in the polyamine-biosynthetic pathway and carries out the final
        step of spermidine biosynthesis. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of putrescine
        to spermidine using decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine as the cofactor. [provided

        SUPV3L1: Enables helicase activity; nucleic acid binding activity; and protein
        homodimerization activity. Involved in several processes, including mitochondrial
        RNA metabolic process; mitochondrion morphogenesis; and positive regulation
        of mitochondrial RNA catabolic process. Located in mitochondrial nucleoid
        and nucleus. Part of mitochondrial degradosome. [provided by Alliance of Genome
        Resources, Apr 2022]


        TBRG4: Enables RNA binding activity. Involved in mitochondrial mRNA processing
        and regulation of mitochondrial mRNA stability. Located in mitochondrial matrix.
        [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        TCOF1: This gene encodes a nucleolar protein with a LIS1 homology domain.
        The protein is involved in ribosomal DNA gene transcription through its interaction
        with upstream binding factor (UBF). Mutations in this gene have been associated
        with Treacher Collins syndrome, a disorder which includes abnormal craniofacial
        development. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have
        been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2008]


        TFB2M: Enables mitochondrial transcription factor activity. Involved in transcription
        initiation from mitochondrial promoter. Located in mitochondrial nucleoid.
        [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        TMEM97: TMEM97 is a conserved integral membrane protein that plays a role
        in controlling cellular cholesterol levels (Bartz et al., 2009 [PubMed 19583955]).[supplied
        by OMIM, Aug 2009]


        UNG: This gene encodes one of several uracil-DNA glycosylases. One important
        function of uracil-DNA glycosylases is to prevent mutagenesis by eliminating
        uracil from DNA molecules by cleaving the N-glycosylic bond and initiating
        the base-excision repair (BER) pathway. Uracil bases occur from cytosine deamination
        or misincorporation of dUMP residues. Alternative promoter usage and splicing
        of this gene leads to two different isoforms: the mitochondrial UNG1 and the
        nuclear UNG2. The UNG2 term was used as a previous symbol for the CCNO gene
        (GeneID 10309), which has been confused with this gene, in the literature
        and some databases. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010]


        UTP20: UTP20 is a component of the U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) (SNORD3A;
        MIM 180710) protein complex (U3 snoRNP) and is involved in 18S rRNA processing
        (Wang et al., 2007 [PubMed 17498821]).[supplied by OMIM, Jun 2009]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        AIMP2: The protein encoded by this gene is part of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
        complex, which contains nine different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and three
        non-enzymatic factors. The encoded protein is one of the non-enzymatic factors
        and is required for assembly and stability of the complex. [provided by RefSeq,
        May 2016]


        BYSL: Bystin is expressed as a 2-kb major transcript and a 3.6-kb minor transcript
        in SNG-M cells and in human trophoblastic teratocarcinoma HT-H cells. Protein
        binding assays determined that bystin binds directly to trophinin and tastin,
        and that binding is enhanced when cytokeratins 8 and 18 are present. Immunocytochemistry
        of HT-H cells showed that bystin colocalizes with trophinin, tastin, and the
        cytokeratins, suggesting that these molecules form a complex in trophectoderm
        cells at the time of implantation. Using immunohistochemistry it was determined
        that trophinin and bystin are found in the placenta from the sixth week of
        pregnancy. Both proteins were localized in the cytoplasm of the syncytiotrophoblast
        in the chorionic villi and in endometrial decidual cells at the uteroplacental
        interface. After week 10, the levels of trophinin, tastin, and bystin decreased
        and then disappeared from placental villi. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        CBX3: At the nuclear envelope, the nuclear lamina and heterochromatin are
        adjacent to the inner nuclear membrane. The protein encoded by this gene binds
        DNA and is a component of heterochromatin. This protein also can bind lamin
        B receptor, an integral membrane protein found in the inner nuclear membrane.
        The dual binding functions of the encoded protein may explain the association
        of heterochromatin with the inner nuclear membrane. This protein binds histone
        H3 tails methylated at Lys-9 sites. This protein is also recruited to sites
        of ultraviolet-induced DNA damage and double-strand breaks. Two transcript
        variants encoding the same protein but differing in the 5'' UTR, have been
        found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2011]


        CDK4: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Ser/Thr protein
        kinase family. This protein is highly similar to the gene products of S. cerevisiae
        cdc28 and S. pombe cdc2. It is a catalytic subunit of the protein kinase complex
        that is important for cell cycle G1 phase progression. The activity of this
        kinase is restricted to the G1-S phase, which is controlled by the regulatory
        subunits D-type cyclins and CDK inhibitor p16(INK4a). This kinase was shown
        to be responsible for the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma gene product (Rb).
        Mutations in this gene as well as in its related proteins including D-type
        cyclins, p16(INK4a) and Rb were all found to be associated with tumorigenesis
        of a variety of cancers. Multiple polyadenylation sites of this gene have
        been reported. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        DCTPP1: The protein encoded by this gene is dCTP pyrophosphatase, which converts
        dCTP to dCMP and inorganic pyrophosphate. The encoded protein also displays
        weak activity against dTTP and dATP, but none against dGTP. This protein may
        be responsible for eliminating excess dCTP after DNA synthesis and may prevent
        overmethylation of CpG islands. Three transcript variants, one protein-coding
        and the other two non-protein coding, have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Dec 2015]


        DDX18: DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp
        (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular
        processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation
        initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome
        assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family
        are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular
        growth and division. This gene encodes a DEAD box protein, and it is activated
        by Myc protein. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        DUSP2: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the dual specificity
        protein phosphatase subfamily.  These phosphatases inactivate their target
        kinases by dephosphorylating both the phosphoserine/threonine and phosphotyrosine
        residues.  They negatively regulate members of the mitogen-activated protein
        (MAP) kinase superfamily (MAPK/ERK, SAPK/JNK, p38), which are associated with
        cellular proliferation and differentiation.  Different members of the family
        of dual specificity phosphatases show distinct substrate specificities for
        various MAP kinases, different tissue distribution and subcellular localization,
        and different modes of inducibility of their expression by extracellular stimuli.  This
        gene product inactivates ERK1 and ERK2, is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic
        tissues, and is localized in the nucleus. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        EXOSC5: Predicted to enable RNA binding activity. Involved in DNA deamination
        and exonucleolytic catabolism of deadenylated mRNA. Acts upstream of or within
        defense response to virus. Located in nucleolus; nucleoplasm; and transcriptionally
        active chromatin. Part of exosome (RNase complex). [provided by Alliance of
        Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        FARSA: Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are a class of enzymes that charge tRNAs
        with their cognate amino acids. This gene encodes a product which is similar
        to the catalytic subunit of prokaryotic and Saccharomyces cerevisiae phenylalanyl-tRNA
        synthetases (PheRS). This gene product has been shown to be expressed in a
        tumor-selective and cell cycle stage- and differentiation-dependent manner,
        the first member of the tRNA synthetase gene family shown to exhibit this
        type of regulated expression [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        GNL3: The protein encoded by this gene may interact with p53 and may be involved
        in tumorigenesis. The encoded protein also appears to be important for stem
        cell proliferation. This protein is found in both the nucleus and nucleolus.
        Three transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found
        for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010]


        GRWD1: This gene encodes a glutamate-rich protein that contains five WD-repeat
        motifs. The encoded protein may play a critical role in ribosome biogenesis
        and may also play a role in histone methylation through interactions with
        CUL4-DDB1 ubiquitin E3 ligase. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2012]


        HK2: Hexokinases phosphorylate glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate, the
        first step in most glucose metabolism pathways. This gene encodes hexokinase
        2, the predominant form found in skeletal muscle. It localizes to the outer
        membrane of mitochondria. Expression of this gene is insulin-responsive, and
        studies in rat suggest that it is involved in the increased rate of glycolysis
        seen in rapidly growing cancer cells. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2009]


        HSPD1: This gene encodes a member of the chaperonin family. The encoded mitochondrial
        protein may function as a signaling molecule in the innate immune system.
        This protein is essential for the folding and assembly of newly imported proteins
        in the mitochondria. This gene is adjacent to a related family member and
        the region between the 2 genes functions as a bidirectional promoter. Several
        pseudogenes have been associated with this gene. Two transcript variants encoding
        the same protein have been identified for this gene. Mutations associated
        with this gene cause autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia 13. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jun 2010]


        HSPE1: This gene encodes a major heat shock protein which functions as a chaperonin.
        Its structure consists of a heptameric ring which binds to another heat shock
        protein in order to form a symmetric, functional heterodimer which enhances
        protein folding in an ATP-dependent manner. This gene and its co-chaperonin,
        HSPD1, are arranged in a head-to-head orientation on chromosome 2. Naturally
        occurring read-through transcription occurs between this locus and the neighboring
        locus MOBKL3.[provided by RefSeq, Feb 2011]


        IMP4: The protein encoded by this gene, along with IMP3 and MPP10, is part
        of the 60-80S U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (U3 snoRNP) complex. This
        complex is necessary for the early cleavage steps of pre-18S ribosomal RNA
        processing. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been
        found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        IPO4: Predicted to enable nuclear import signal receptor activity and nuclear
        localization sequence binding activity. Involved in DNA replication-dependent
        chromatin assembly; DNA replication-independent chromatin assembly; and protein
        import into nucleus. Located in chromatin. Part of protein-containing complex.
        [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        LAS1L: Enables RNA binding activity. Predicted to be involved in maturation
        of 5.8S rRNA and maturation of LSU-rRNA. Located in membrane. Part of MLL1
        complex. Implicated in Wilson-Turner syndrome. [provided by Alliance of Genome
        Resources, Apr 2022]


        MAP3K6: This gene encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that forms a component
        of protein kinase-mediated signal transduction cascades. The encoded kinase
        participates in the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
        expression. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
        [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2014]


        MCM4: The protein encoded by this gene is one of the highly conserved mini-chromosome
        maintenance proteins (MCM) that are essential for the initiation of eukaryotic
        genome replication. The hexameric protein complex formed by MCM proteins is
        a key component of the pre-replication complex (pre_RC) and may be involved
        in the formation of replication forks and in the recruitment of other DNA
        replication related proteins. The MCM complex consisting of this protein and
        MCM2, 6 and 7 proteins possesses DNA helicase activity, and may act as a DNA
        unwinding enzyme. The phosphorylation of this protein by CDC2 kinase reduces
        the DNA helicase activity and chromatin binding of the MCM complex. This gene
        is mapped to a region on the chromosome 8 head-to-head next to the PRKDC/DNA-PK,
        a DNA-activated protein kinase involved in the repair of DNA double-strand
        breaks. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein
        have been reported. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        MCM5: The protein encoded by this gene is structurally very similar to the
        CDC46 protein from S. cerevisiae, a protein involved in the initiation of
        DNA replication. The encoded protein is a member of the MCM family of chromatin-binding
        proteins and can interact with at least two other members of this family.
        The encoded protein is upregulated in the transition from the G0 to G1/S phase
        of the cell cycle and may actively participate in cell cycle regulation. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        MPHOSPH10: This gene encodes a protein that is phosphorylated during mitosis.
        The protein localizes to the nucleolus during interphase and to the chromosomes
        during M phase. The protein associates with the U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein
        60-80S complexes and may be involved in pre-rRNA processing. [provided by
        RefSeq, Dec 2010]


        MRTO4: This gene encodes a protein sharing a low level of sequence similarity
        with ribosomal protein P0. While the precise function of the encoded protein
        is currently unknown, it appears to be involved in mRNA turnover and ribosome
        assembly. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        MYBBP1A: This gene encodes a nucleolar transcriptional regulator that was
        first identified by its ability to bind specifically to the Myb proto-oncogene
        protein. The encoded protein is thought to play a role in many cellular processes
        including response to nucleolar stress, tumor suppression and synthesis of
        ribosomal DNA. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
        [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]


        MYC: This gene is a proto-oncogene and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that
        plays a role in cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cellular transformation.
        The encoded protein forms a heterodimer with the related transcription factor
        MAX. This complex binds to the E box DNA consensus sequence and regulates
        the transcription of specific target genes. Amplification of this gene is
        frequently observed in numerous human cancers. Translocations involving this
        gene are associated with Burkitt lymphoma and multiple myeloma in human patients.
        There is evidence to show that translation initiates both from an upstream,
        in-frame non-AUG (CUG) and a downstream AUG start site, resulting in the production
        of two isoforms with distinct N-termini. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        NDUFAF4: NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) catalyzes the transfer
        of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) in the first step of the
        mitochondrial respiratory chain, resulting in the translocation of protons
        across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This gene encodes a complex I assembly
        factor. Mutations in this gene are a cause of mitochondrial complex I deficiency.

        NOP16: This gene encodes a protein that is localized to the nucleolus. Expression
        of this gene is induced by estrogens and Myc protein and is a marker of poor
        patient survival in breast cancer. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2015]


        NOP2: Enables RNA binding activity. Involved in positive regulation of cell
        population proliferation; regulation of signal transduction by p53 class mediator;
        and ribosomal large subunit assembly. Located in nucleolus. [provided by Alliance
        of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        NOP56: Nop56p is a yeast nucleolar protein that is part of a complex with
        the nucleolar proteins Nop58p and fibrillarin. Nop56p is required for assembly
        of the 60S ribosomal subunit and is involved in pre-rRNA processing. The protein
        encoded by this gene is similar in sequence to Nop56p and is also found in
        the nucleolus. Expansion of a GGCCTG repeat from 3-8 copies to 1500-2500 copies
        in an intron of this gene results in spinocerebellar ataxia 36. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding several different isoforms have been found for this gene,
        but the full-length nature of most of them has not been determined. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2016]


        NPM1: The protein encoded by this gene is involved in several cellular processes,
        including centrosome duplication, protein chaperoning, and cell proliferation.
        The encoded phosphoprotein shuttles between the nucleolus, nucleus, and cytoplasm,
        chaperoning ribosomal proteins and core histones from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
        This protein is also known to sequester the tumor suppressor ARF in the nucleolus,
        protecting it from degradation until it is needed. Mutations in this gene
        are associated with acute myeloid leukemia. Dozens of pseudogenes of this
        gene have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        PA2G4: This gene encodes an RNA-binding protein that is involved in growth
        regulation. This protein is present in pre-ribosomal ribonucleoprotein complexes
        and may be involved in ribosome assembly and the regulation of intermediate
        and late steps of rRNA processing. This protein can interact with the cytoplasmic
        domain of the ErbB3 receptor and may contribute to transducing growth regulatory
        signals. This protein is also a transcriptional co-repressor of androgen receptor-regulated
        genes and other cell cycle regulatory genes through its interactions with
        histone deacetylases. This protein has been implicated in growth inhibition
        and the induction of differentiation of human cancer cells. Six pseudogenes,
        located on chromosomes 3, 6, 9, 18, 20 and X, have been identified. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PES1: This gene encodes a nuclear protein that contains a breast cancer associated
        gene 1 (BRCA1) C-terminal interaction domain. The encoded protein interacts
        with BOP1 and WDR12 to form the PeBoW complex, which plays a critical role
        in cell proliferation via pre-rRNA processing and 60S ribosomal subunit maturation.
        Expression of this gene may play an important role in breast cancer proliferation
        and tumorigenicity. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple
        isoforms have been observed for this gene. Pseudogenes of this gene are located
        on the long arm of chromosome 4 and the short arm of chromosome 9. [provided
        by RefSeq, Aug 2011]


        PHB1: This gene is evolutionarily conserved, and its product is proposed to
        play a role in human cellular senescence and tumor suppression. Antiproliferative
        activity is reported to be localized to the 3'' UTR, which is proposed to
        function as a trans-acting regulatory RNA. Several pseudogenes of this gene
        have been identified. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]


        PLK1: The Ser/Thr protein kinase encoded by this gene belongs to the CDC5/Polo
        subfamily. It is highly expressed during mitosis and elevated levels are found
        in many different types of cancer. Depletion of this protein in cancer cells
        dramatically inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis; hence, it
        is a target for cancer therapy. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]


        PLK4: This gene encodes a member of the polo family of serine/threonine protein
        kinases. The protein localizes to centrioles, complex microtubule-based structures
        found in centrosomes, and regulates centriole duplication during the cell
        cycle. Three alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different
        protein isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2010]


        PPAN: The protein encoded by this gene is an evolutionarily conserved protein
        similar to yeast SSF1 as well as to the gene product of the Drosophila gene
        peter pan (ppan). SSF1 is known to be involved in the second step of mRNA
        splicing. Both SSF1 and ppan are essential for cell growth and proliferation.
        Exogenous expression of this gene was reported to reduce the anchorage-independent
        growth of some tumor cells. Read-through transcription of this gene with P2RY11/P2Y(11),
        an adjacent downstream gene that encodes an ATP receptor, has been found.
        These read-through transcripts are ubiquitously present and up-regulated during
        granulocyte differentiation. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010]


        PPRC1: The protein encoded by this gene is similar to PPAR-gamma coactivator
        1 (PPARGC1/PGC-1), a protein that can activate mitochondrial biogenesis in
        part through a direct interaction with nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1).
        This protein has been shown to interact with NRF1. It is thought to be a functional
        relative of PPAR-gamma coactivator 1 that activates mitochondrial biogenesis
        through NRF1 in response to proliferative signals. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2013]


        PRMT3: This gene belongs to the protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT)
        family. The encoded enzyme catalyzes the methylation of guanidino nitrogens
        of arginyl residues of proteins. The enzyme acts on 40S ribosomal protein
        S2 (rpS2), which is its major in-vivo substrate, and is involved in the proper
        maturation of the 80S ribosome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2013]


        PUS1: This gene encodes a pseudouridine synthase that converts uridine to
        pseudouridine once it has been incorporated into an RNA molecule. The encoded
        enzyme may play an essential role in tRNA function and in stabilizing the
        secondary and tertiary structure of many RNAs. A mutation in this gene has
        been linked to mitochondrial myopathy and sideroblastic anemia. Alternate
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Sep
        2009]


        RABEPK: Predicted to be involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis and vesicle
        docking involved in exocytosis. Predicted to be located in cytoplasmic vesicle;
        cytosol; and trans-Golgi network membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome
        Resources, Apr 2022]


        RCL1: Predicted to enable endoribonuclease activity. Predicted to be involved
        in endonucleolytic cleavage of tricistronic rRNA transcript (SSU-rRNA, 5.8S
        rRNA, LSU-rRNA). Predicted to act upstream of or within endonucleolytic cleavage
        in 5''-ETS of tricistronic rRNA transcript (SSU-rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, LSU-rRNA)
        and endonucleolytic cleavage in ITS1 to separate SSU-rRNA from 5.8S rRNA and
        LSU-rRNA from tricistronic rRNA transcript (SSU-rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, LSU-rRNA).
        Predicted to be located in nucleoplasm. Predicted to be active in nucleolus.

        RRP12: Enables RNA binding activity. Predicted to be involved in rRNA processing.
        Located in cytosol; nucleolus; and plasma membrane. [provided by Alliance
        of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        RRP9: This gene encodes a member of the WD-repeat protein family. The encoded
        protein is a component of the nucleolar small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle
        (snoRNP) and is essential for 18s rRNA processing during ribosome synthesis.
        It contains seven WD domains required for nucleolar localization and specific
        interaction with the U3 small nucleolar RNA (U3 snoRNA). [provided by RefSeq,
        Oct 2012]


        SLC19A1: The membrane protein encoded by this gene is a transporter of folate
        and is involved in the regulation of intracellular concentrations of folate.
        Three transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for
        this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2011]


        SLC29A2: The uptake of nucleosides by transporters, such as SLC29A2, is essential
        for nucleotide synthesis by salvage pathways in cells that lack de novo biosynthetic
        pathways. Nucleoside transport also plays a key role in the regulation of
        many physiologic processes through its effect on adenosine concentration at
        the cell surface (Griffiths et al., 1997 [PubMed 9396714]).[supplied by OMIM,
        Nov 2008]


        SORD: Sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD; EC 1.1.1.14) catalyzes the interconversion
        of polyols and their corresponding ketoses, and together with aldose reductase
        (ALDR1; MIM 103880), makes up the sorbitol pathway that is believed to play
        an important role in the development of diabetic complications (summarized
        by Carr and Markham, 1995 [PubMed 8535074]). The first reaction of the pathway
        (also called the polyol pathway) is the reduction of glucose to sorbitol by
        ALDR1 with NADPH as the cofactor. SORD then oxidizes the sorbitol to fructose
        using NAD(+) cofactor.[supplied by OMIM, Jul 2010]


        SRM: The polyamines putrescine, spermine, and spermidine are ubiquitous polycationic
        mediators of cell growth and differentiation. Spermidine synthase is one of
        four enzymes in the polyamine-biosynthetic pathway and carries out the final
        step of spermidine biosynthesis. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of putrescine
        to spermidine using decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine as the cofactor. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        SUPV3L1: Enables helicase activity; nucleic acid binding activity; and protein
        homodimerization activity. Involved in several processes, including mitochondrial
        RNA metabolic process; mitochondrion morphogenesis; and positive regulation
        of mitochondrial RNA catabolic process. Located in mitochondrial nucleoid
        and nucleus. Part of mitochondrial degradosome. [provided by Alliance of Genome
        Resources, Apr 2022]

        TCOF1: This gene encodes a nucleolar protein with a LIS1 homology domain.
        The protein is involved in ribosomal DNA gene transcription through its interaction
        with upstream binding factor (UBF). Mutations in this gene have been associated
        with Treacher Collins syndrome, a disorder which includes abnormal craniofacial
        development. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have
        been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2008]

        initiation from mitochondrial promoter. Located in mitochondrial nucleoid.
        [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        TMEM97: TMEM97 is a conserved integral membrane protein that plays a role
        in controlling cellular cholesterol levels (Bartz et al., 2009 [PubMed 19583955]).[supplied
        by OMIM, Aug 2009]


        UNG: This gene encodes one of several uracil-DNA glycosylases. One important
        function of uracil-DNA glycosylases is to prevent mutagenesis by eliminating
        uracil from DNA molecules by cleaving the N-glycosylic bond and initiating
        the base-excision repair (BER) pathway. Uracil bases occur from cytosine deamination
        or misincorporation of dUMP residues. Alternative promoter usage and splicing
        of this gene leads to two different isoforms: the mitochondrial UNG1 and the
        nuclear UNG2. The UNG2 term was used as a previous symbol for the CCNO gene
        (GeneID 10309), which has been confused with this gene, in the literature
        and some databases. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010]


        UTP20: UTP20 is a component of the U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) (SNORD3A;

        Here are the gene summaries:



        GNL3: The protein encoded by this gene may interact with p53 and may be involved
        in tumorigenesis. The encoded protein also appears to be important for stem
        cell proliferation. This protein is found in both the nucleus and nucleolus.
        Three transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found
        for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010]


        TMEM97: TMEM97 is a conserved integral membrane protein that plays a role
        in controlling cellular cholesterol levels (Bartz et al., 2009 [PubMed 19583955]).[supplied
        by OMIM, Aug 2009]


        RABEPK: Predicted to be involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis and vesicle
        docking involved in exocytosis. Predicted to be located in cytoplasmic vesicle;
        cytosol; and trans-Golgi network membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome
        Resources, Apr 2022]


        WDR74: Involved in rRNA processing and ribosomal large subunit biogenesis.
        Located in nucleoplasm. Colocalizes with nuclear exosome (RNase complex) and
        nucleolus. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        PPRC1: The protein encoded by this gene is similar to PPAR-gamma coactivator
        1 (PPARGC1/PGC-1), a protein that can activate mitochondrial biogenesis in
        part through a direct interaction with nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1).
        This protein has been shown to interact with NRF1. It is thought to be a functional
        relative of PPAR-gamma coactivator 1 that activates mitochondrial biogenesis
        through NRF1 in response to proliferative signals. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2013]


        HSPE1: This gene encodes a major heat shock protein which functions as a chaperonin.
        Its structure consists of a heptameric ring which binds to another heat shock
        protein in order to form a symmetric, functional heterodimer which enhances
        protein folding in an ATP-dependent manner. This gene and its co-chaperonin,
        HSPD1, are arranged in a head-to-head orientation on chromosome 2. Naturally
        occurring read-through transcription occurs between this locus and the neighboring
        locus MOBKL3.[provided by RefSeq, Feb 2011]


        PPAN: The protein encoded by this gene is an evolutionarily conserved protein
        similar to yeast SSF1 as well as to the gene product of the Drosophila gene
        peter pan (ppan). SSF1 is known to be involved in the second step of mRNA
        splicing. Both SSF1 and ppan are essential for cell growth and proliferation.
        Exogenous expression of this gene was reported to reduce the anchorage-independent
        growth of some tumor cells. Read-through transcription of this gene with P2RY11/P2Y(11),
        an adjacent downstream gene that encodes an ATP receptor, has been found.
        These read-through transcripts are ubiquitously present and up-regulated during
        granulocyte differentiation. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010]


        MCM4: The protein encoded by this gene is one of the highly conserved mini-chromosome
        maintenance proteins (MCM) that are essential for the initiation of eukaryotic
        genome replication. The hexameric protein complex formed by MCM proteins is
        a key component of the pre-replication complex (pre_RC) and may be involved
        in the formation of replication forks and in the recruitment of other DNA
        replication related proteins. The MCM complex consisting of this protein and
        MCM2, 6 and 7 proteins possesses DNA helicase activity, and may act as a DNA
        unwinding enzyme. The phosphorylation of this protein by CDC2 kinase reduces
        the DNA helicase activity and chromatin binding of the MCM complex. This gene
        is mapped to a region on the chromosome 8 head-to-head next to the PRKDC/DNA-PK,
        a DNA-activated protein kinase involved in the repair of DNA double-strand
        breaks. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein
        have been reported. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PLK1: The Ser/Thr protein kinase encoded by this gene belongs to the CDC5/Polo
        subfamily. It is highly expressed during mitosis and elevated levels are found
        in many different types of cancer. Depletion of this protein in cancer cells
        dramatically inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis; hence, it
        is a target for cancer therapy. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]


        PES1: This gene encodes a nuclear protein that contains a breast cancer associated
        gene 1 (BRCA1) C-terminal interaction domain. The encoded protein interacts
        with BOP1 and WDR12 to form the PeBoW complex, which plays a critical role
        in cell proliferation via pre-rRNA processing and 60S ribosomal subunit maturation.
        Expression of this gene may play an important role in breast cancer proliferation
        and tumorigenicity. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple
        isoforms have been observed for this gene. Pseudogenes of this gene are located
        on the long arm of chromosome 4 and the short arm of chromosome 9. [provided
        by RefSeq, Aug 2011]


        SUPV3L1: Enables helicase activity; nucleic acid binding activity; and protein
        homodimerization activity. Involved in several processes, including mitochondrial
        RNA metabolic process; mitochondrion morphogenesis; and positive regulation
        of mitochondrial RNA catabolic process. Located in mitochondrial nucleoid
        and nucleus. Part of mitochondrial degradosome. [provided by Alliance of Genome
        Resources, Apr 2022]


        SLC29A2: The uptake of nucleosides by transporters, such as SLC29A2, is essential
        for nucleotide synthesis by salvage pathways in cells that lack de novo biosynthetic
        pathways. Nucleoside transport also plays a key role in the regulation of
        many physiologic processes through its effect on adenosine concentration at
        the cell surface (Griffiths et al., 1997 [PubMed 9396714]).[supplied by OMIM,
        Nov 2008]


        IMP4: The protein encoded by this gene, along with IMP3 and MPP10, is part
        of the 60-80S U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (U3 snoRNP) complex. This
        complex is necessary for the early cleavage steps of pre-18S ribosomal RNA
        processing. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been
        found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        HSPD1: This gene encodes a member of the chaperonin family. The encoded mitochondrial
        protein may function as a signaling molecule in the innate immune system.
        This protein is essential for the folding and assembly of newly imported proteins
        in the mitochondria. This gene is adjacent to a related family member and
        the region between the 2 genes functions as a bidirectional promoter. Several
        pseudogenes have been associated with this gene. Two transcript variants encoding
        the same protein have been identified for this gene. Mutations associated
        with this gene cause autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia 13. [provided

        MYC: This gene is a proto-oncogene and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that
        plays a role in cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cellular transformation.
        The encoded protein forms a heterodimer with the related transcription factor
        MAX. This complex binds to the E box DNA consensus sequence and regulates
        the transcription of specific target genes. Amplification of this gene is
        frequently observed in numerous human cancers. Translocations involving this
        gene are associated with Burkitt lymphoma and multiple myeloma in human patients.
        There is evidence to show that translation initiates both from an upstream,
        in-frame non-AUG (CUG) and a downstream AUG start site, resulting in the production
        of two isoforms with distinct N-termini. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        CDK4: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Ser/Thr protein
        kinase family. This protein is highly similar to the gene products of S. cerevisiae
        cdc28 and S. pombe cdc2. It is a catalytic subunit of the protein kinase complex
        that is important for cell cycle G1 phase progression. The activity of this
        kinase is restricted to the G1-S phase, which is controlled by the regulatory
        subunits D-type cyclins and CDK inhibitor p16(INK4a). This kinase was shown
        to be responsible for the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma gene product (Rb).
        Mutations in this gene as well as in its related proteins including D-type
        cyclins, p16(INK4a) and Rb were all found to be associated with tumorigenesis
        of a variety of cancers. Multiple polyadenylation sites of this gene have
        been reported. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PRMT3: This gene belongs to the protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT)
        family. The encoded enzyme catalyzes the methylation of guanidino nitrogens
        of arginyl residues of proteins. The enzyme acts on 40S ribosomal protein
        S2 (rpS2), which is its major in-vivo substrate, and is involved in the proper
        maturation of the 80S ribosome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2013]


        RRP12: Enables RNA binding activity. Predicted to be involved in rRNA processing.

        NOLC1: Enables protein heterodimerization activity and protein-macromolecule
        adaptor activity. Involved in neural crest cell development; neural crest
        formation; and regulation of translation. Located in fibrillar center. [provided
        by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        UNG: This gene encodes one of several uracil-DNA glycosylases. One important
        function of uracil-DNA glycosylases is to prevent mutagenesis by eliminating
        uracil from DNA molecules by cleaving the N-glycosylic bond and initiating
        the base-excision repair (BER) pathway. Uracil bases occur from cytosine deamination
        or misincorporation of dUMP residues. Alternative promoter usage and splicing
        of this gene leads to two different isoforms: the mitochondrial UNG1 and the
        nuclear UNG2. The UNG2 term was used as a previous symbol for the CCNO gene
        (GeneID 10309), which has been confused with this gene, in the literature
        and some databases. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010]


        TCOF1: This gene encodes a nucleolar protein with a LIS1 homology domain.
        The protein is involved in ribosomal DNA gene transcription through its interaction
        with upstream binding factor (UBF). Mutations in this gene have been associated
        with Treacher Collins syndrome, a disorder which includes abnormal craniofacial
        development. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have
        been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2008]


        RRP9: This gene encodes a member of the WD-repeat protein family. The encoded
        protein is a component of the nucleolar small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle
        (snoRNP) and is essential for 18s rRNA processing during ribosome synthesis.
        It contains seven WD domains required for nucleolar localization and specific
        interaction with the U3 small nucleolar RNA (U3 snoRNA). [provided by RefSeq,
        Oct 2012]


        MYBBP1A: This gene encodes a nucleolar transcriptional regulator that was
        first identified by its ability to bind specifically to the Myb proto-oncogene
        protein. The encoded protein is thought to play a role in many cellular processes
        including response to nucleolar stress, tumor suppression and synthesis of
        ribosomal DNA. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
        [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]


        NOP56: Nop56p is a yeast nucleolar protein that is part of a complex with
        the nucleolar proteins Nop58p and fibrillarin. Nop56p is required for assembly
        of the 60S ribosomal subunit and is involved in pre-rRNA processing. The protein
        encoded by this gene is similar in sequence to Nop56p and is also found in
        the nucleolus. Expansion of a GGCCTG repeat from 3-8 copies to 1500-2500 copies
        in an intron of this gene results in spinocerebellar ataxia 36. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding several different isoforms have been found for this gene,
        but the full-length nature of most of them has not been determined. [provided

        DUSP2: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the dual specificity
        protein phosphatase subfamily.  These phosphatases inactivate their target
        kinases by dephosphorylating both the phosphoserine/threonine and phosphotyrosine
        residues.  They negatively regulate members of the mitogen-activated protein
        (MAP) kinase superfamily (MAPK/ERK, SAPK/JNK, p38), which are associated with
        cellular proliferation and differentiation.  Different members of the family
        of dual specificity phosphatases show distinct substrate specificities for
        various MAP kinases, different tissue distribution and subcellular localization,
        and different modes of inducibility of their expression by extracellular stimuli.  This
        gene product inactivates ERK1 and ERK2, is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic
        tissues, and is localized in the nucleus. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        PHB1: This gene is evolutionarily conserved, and its product is proposed to
        play a role in human cellular senescence and tumor suppression. Antiproliferative
        activity is reported to be localized to the 3'' UTR, which is proposed to
        function as a trans-acting regulatory RNA. Several pseudogenes of this gene

        (Wang et al., 2007 [PubMed 17498821]).[supplied by OMIM, Jun 2009]


        PUS1: This gene encodes a pseudouridine synthase that converts uridine to
        pseudouridine once it has been incorporated into an RNA molecule. The encoded
        enzyme may play an essential role in tRNA function and in stabilizing the
        secondary and tertiary structure of many RNAs. A mutation in this gene has
        been linked to mitochondrial myopathy and sideroblastic anemia. Alternate
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Sep

        BYSL: Bystin is expressed as a 2-kb major transcript and a 3.6-kb minor transcript
        in SNG-M cells and in human trophoblastic teratocarcinoma HT-H cells. Protein
        binding assays determined that bystin binds directly to trophinin and tastin,
        and that binding is enhanced when cytokeratins 8 and 18 are present. Immunocytochemistry
        of HT-H cells showed that bystin colocalizes with trophinin, tastin, and the
        cytokeratins, suggesting that these molecules form a complex in trophectoderm
        cells at the time of implantation. Using immunohistochemistry it was determined
        that trophinin and bystin are found in the placenta from the sixth week of
        pregnancy. Both proteins were localized in the cytoplasm of the syncytiotrophoblast
        in the chorionic villi and in endometrial decidual cells at the uteroplacental
        interface. After week 10, the levels of trophinin, tastin, and bystin decreased
        and then disappeared from placental villi. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        cycle. Three alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different
        protein isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2010]


        DDX18: DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp
        (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular
        processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation
        initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome
        assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family
        are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular
        growth and division. This gene encodes a DEAD box protein, and it is activated
        by Myc protein. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        SORD: Sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD; EC 1.1.1.14) catalyzes the interconversion
        of polyols and their corresponding ketoses, and together with aldose reductase
        (ALDR1; MIM 103880), makes up the sorbitol pathway that is believed to play
        an important role in the development of diabetic complications (summarized
        by Carr and Markham, 1995 [PubMed 8535074]). The first reaction of the pathway
        (also called the polyol pathway) is the reduction of glucose to sorbitol by
        ALDR1 with NADPH as the cofactor. SORD then oxidizes the sorbitol to fructose
        using NAD(+) cofactor.[supplied by OMIM, Jul 2010]

        CBX3: At the nuclear envelope, the nuclear lamina and heterochromatin are
        adjacent to the inner nuclear membrane. The protein encoded by this gene binds
        DNA and is a component of heterochromatin. This protein also can bind lamin
        B receptor, an integral membrane protein found in the inner nuclear membrane.
        The dual binding functions of the encoded protein may explain the association
        of heterochromatin with the inner nuclear membrane. This protein binds histone
        H3 tails methylated at Lys-9 sites. This protein is also recruited to sites
        of ultraviolet-induced DNA damage and double-strand breaks. Two transcript

        including centrosome duplication, protein chaperoning, and cell proliferation.
        The encoded phosphoprotein shuttles between the nucleolus, nucleus, and cytoplasm,
        chaperoning ribosomal proteins and core histones from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
        This protein is also known to sequester the tumor suppressor ARF in the nucleolus,
        protecting it from degradation until it is needed. Mutations in this gene

        dCTP to dCMP and inorganic pyrophosphate. The encoded protein also displays
        weak activity against dTTP and dATP, but none against dGTP. This protein may
        be responsible for eliminating excess dCTP after DNA synthesis and may prevent
        overmethylation of CpG islands. Three transcript variants, one protein-coding

        DNA replication. The encoded protein is a member of the MCM family of chromatin-binding
        proteins and can interact with at least two other members of this family.
        The encoded protein is upregulated in the transition from the G0 to G1/S phase
        of the cell cycle and may actively participate in cell cycle regulation. [provided

        PPRC1: The protein encoded by this gene is similar to PPAR-gamma coactivator
        1 (PPARGC1/PGC-1), a protein that can activate mitochondrial biogenesis in
        part through a direct interaction with nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1).
        This protein has been shown to interact with NRF1. It is thought to be a functional
        relative of PPAR-gamma coactivator 1 that activates mitochondrial biogenesis
        through NRF1 in response to proliferative signals. Alternative splicing results

        HSPE1: This gene encodes a major heat shock protein which functions as a chaperonin.
        Its structure consists of a heptameric ring which binds to another heat shock
        protein in order to form a symmetric, functional heterodimer which enhances
        protein folding in an ATP-dependent manner. This gene and its co-chaperonin,
        HSPD1, are arranged in a head-to-head orientation on chromosome 2. Naturally

        splicing. Both SSF1 and ppan are essential for cell growth and proliferation.
        Exogenous expression of this gene was reported to reduce the anchorage-independent
        growth of some tumor cells. Read-through transcription of this gene with P2RY11/P2Y(11),
        an adjacent downstream gene that encodes an ATP receptor, has been found.

        granulocyte differentiation. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010]


        MCM4: The protein encoded by this gene is one of the highly conserved mini-chromosome
        maintenance proteins (MCM) that are essential for the initiation of eukaryotic

        a key component of the pre-replication complex (pre_RC) and may be involved
        in the formation of replication forks and in the recruitment of other DNA
        replication related proteins. The MCM complex consisting of this protein and
        MCM2, 6 and 7 proteins possesses DNA helicase activity, and may act as a DNA
        unwinding enzyme. The phosphorylation of this protein by CDC2 kinase reduces
        the DNA helicase activity and chromatin binding of the MCM complex. This gene
        is mapped to a region on the chromosome 8 head-to-head next to the PRKDC/DNA-PK,
        a DNA-activated protein kinase involved in the repair of DNA double-strand
        breaks. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein
        have been reported. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PLK1: The Ser/Thr protein kinase encoded by this gene belongs to the CDC5/Polo
        subfamily. It is highly expressed during mitosis and elevated levels are found
        in many different types of cancer. Depletion of this protein in cancer cells
        dramatically inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis; hence, it
        is a target for cancer therapy. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]


        PES1: This gene encodes a nuclear protein that contains a breast cancer associated
        gene 1 (BRCA1) C-terminal interaction domain. The encoded protein interacts
        with BOP1 and WDR12 to form the PeBoW complex, which plays a critical role
        in cell proliferation via pre-rRNA processing and 60S ribosomal subunit maturation.
        Expression of this gene may play an important role in breast cancer proliferation
        and tumorigenicity. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple
        isoforms have been observed for this gene. Pseudogenes of this gene are located
        on the long arm of chromosome 4 and the short arm of chromosome 9. [provided

        SUPV3L1: Enables helicase activity; nucleic acid binding activity; and protein
        homodimerization activity. Involved in several processes, including mitochondrial
        RNA metabolic process; mitochondrion morphogenesis; and positive regulation
        of mitochondrial RNA catabolic process. Located in mitochondrial nucleoid
        and nucleus. Part of mitochondrial degradosome. [provided by Alliance of Genome
        Resources, Apr 2022]


        SLC29A2: The uptake of nucleosides by transporters, such as SLC29A2, is essential
        for nucleotide synthesis by salvage pathways in cells that lack de novo biosynthetic
        pathways. Nucleoside transport also plays a key role in the regulation of
        many physiologic processes through its effect on adenosine concentration at
        the cell surface (Griffiths et al., 1997 [PubMed 9396714]).[supplied by OMIM,
        Nov 2008]


        IMP4: The protein encoded by this gene, along with IMP3 and MPP10, is part
        of the 60-80S U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (U3 snoRNP) complex. This
        complex is necessary for the early cleavage steps of pre-18S ribosomal RNA
        processing. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been
        found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        HSPD1: This gene encodes a member of the chaperonin family. The encoded mitochondrial
        protein may function as a signaling molecule in the innate immune system.
        This protein is essential for the folding and assembly of newly imported proteins
        in the mitochondria. This gene is adjacent to a related family member and
        the region between the 2 genes functions as a bidirectional promoter. Several
        pseudogenes have been associated with this gene. Two transcript variants encoding
        the same protein have been identified for this gene. Mutations associated
        with this gene cause autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia 13. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jun 2010]


        MYC: This gene is a proto-oncogene and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that
        plays a role in cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cellular transformation.
        The encoded protein forms a heterodimer with the related transcription factor
        MAX. This complex binds to the E box DNA consensus sequence and regulates
        the transcription of specific target genes. Amplification of this gene is
        frequently observed in numerous human cancers. Translocations involving this
        gene are associated with Burkitt lymphoma and multiple myeloma in human patients.
        There is evidence to show that translation initiates both from an upstream,
        in-frame non-AUG (CUG) and a downstream AUG start site, resulting in the production
        of two isoforms with distinct N-termini. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        CDK4: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Ser/Thr protein
        kinase family. This protein is highly similar to the gene products of S. cerevisiae
        cdc28 and S. pombe cdc2. It is a catalytic subunit of the protein kinase complex
        that is important for cell cycle G1 phase progression. The activity of this
        kinase is restricted to the G1-S phase, which is controlled by the regulatory
        subunits D-type cyclins and CDK inhibitor p16(INK4a). This kinase was shown
        to be responsible for the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma gene product (Rb).
        Mutations in this gene as well as in its related proteins including D-type
        cyclins, p16(INK4a) and Rb were all found to be associated with tumorigenesis
        of a variety of cancers. Multiple polyadenylation sites of this gene have
        been reported. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PRMT3: This gene belongs to the protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT)
        family. The encoded enzyme catalyzes the methylation of guanidino nitrogens
        of arginyl residues of proteins. The enzyme acts on 40S ribosomal protein
        S2 (rpS2), which is its major in-vivo substrate, and is involved in the proper
        maturation of the 80S ribosome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2013]


        RRP12: Enables RNA binding activity. Predicted to be involved in rRNA processing.

        of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        NOLC1: Enables protein heterodimerization activity and protein-macromolecule
        adaptor activity. Involved in neural crest cell development; neural crest
        formation; and regulation of translation. Located in fibrillar center. [provided
        by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        UNG: This gene encodes one of several uracil-DNA glycosylases. One important
        function of uracil-DNA glycosylases is to prevent mutagenesis by eliminating
        uracil from DNA molecules by cleaving the N-glycosylic bond and initiating
        the base-excision repair (BER) pathway. Uracil bases occur from cytosine deamination
        or misincorporation of dUMP residues. Alternative promoter usage and splicing
        of this gene leads to two different isoforms: the mitochondrial UNG1 and the
        nuclear UNG2. The UNG2 term was used as a previous symbol for the CCNO gene
        (GeneID 10309), which has been confused with this gene, in the literature
        and some databases. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010]


        TCOF1: This gene encodes a nucleolar protein with a LIS1 homology domain.
        The protein is involved in ribosomal DNA gene transcription through its interaction
        with upstream binding factor (UBF). Mutations in this gene have been associated
        with Treacher Collins syndrome, a disorder which includes abnormal craniofacial
        development. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have
        been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2008]


        RRP9: This gene encodes a member of the WD-repeat protein family. The encoded
        protein is a component of the nucleolar small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle
        (snoRNP) and is essential for 18s rRNA processing during ribosome synthesis.
        It contains seven WD domains required for nucleolar localization and specific
        interaction with the U3 small nucleolar RNA (U3 snoRNA). [provided by RefSeq,
        Oct 2012]


        MYBBP1A: This gene encodes a nucleolar transcriptional regulator that was
        first identified by its ability to bind specifically to the Myb proto-oncogene
        protein. The encoded protein is thought to play a role in many cellular processes
        including response to nucleolar stress, tumor suppression and synthesis of
        ribosomal DNA. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
        [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]


        NOP56: Nop56p is a yeast nucleolar protein that is part of a complex with
        the nucleolar proteins Nop58p and fibrillarin. Nop56p is required for assembly
        of the 60S ribosomal subunit and is involved in pre-rRNA processing. The protein
        encoded by this gene is similar in sequence to Nop56p and is also found in
        the nucleolus. Expansion of a GGCCTG repeat from 3-8 copies to 1500-2500 copies
        in an intron of this gene results in spinocerebellar ataxia 36. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding several different isoforms have been found for this gene,
        but the full-length nature of most of them has not been determined. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2016]


        DUSP2: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the dual specificity
        protein phosphatase subfamily.  These phosphatases inactivate their target
        kinases by dephosphorylating both the phosphoserine/threonine and phosphotyrosine
        residues.  They negatively regulate members of the mitogen-activated protein
        (MAP) kinase superfamily (MAPK/ERK, SAPK/JNK, p38), which are associated with
        cellular proliferation and differentiation.  Different members of the family
        of dual specificity phosphatases show distinct substrate specificities for
        various MAP kinases, different tissue distribution and subcellular localization,
        and different modes of inducibility of their expression by extracellular stimuli.  This
        gene product inactivates ERK1 and ERK2, is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic
        tissues, and is localized in the nucleus. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        PHB1: This gene is evolutionarily conserved, and its product is proposed to
        play a role in human cellular senescence and tumor suppression. Antiproliferative
        activity is reported to be localized to the 3'' UTR, which is proposed to
        function as a trans-acting regulatory RNA. Several pseudogenes of this gene
        have been identified. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript

        UTP20: UTP20 is a component of the U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) (SNORD3A;
        MIM 180710) protein complex (U3 snoRNP) and is involved in 18S rRNA processing
        (Wang et al., 2007 [PubMed 17498821]).[supplied by OMIM, Jun 2009]


        PUS1: This gene encodes a pseudouridine synthase that converts uridine to
        pseudouridine once it has been incorporated into an RNA molecule. The encoded
        enzyme may play an essential role in tRNA function and in stabilizing the
        secondary and tertiary structure of many RNAs. A mutation in this gene has
        been linked to mitochondrial myopathy and sideroblastic anemia. Alternate
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Sep

        BYSL: Bystin is expressed as a 2-kb major transcript and a 3.6-kb minor transcript
        in SNG-M cells and in human trophoblastic teratocarcinoma HT-H cells. Protein
        binding assays determined that bystin binds directly to trophinin and tastin,
        and that binding is enhanced when cytokeratins 8 and 18 are present. Immunocytochemistry
        of HT-H cells showed that bystin colocalizes with trophinin, tastin, and the
        cytokeratins, suggesting that these molecules form a complex in trophectoderm
        cells at the time of implantation. Using immunohistochemistry it was determined
        that trophinin and bystin are found in the placenta from the sixth week of
        pregnancy. Both proteins were localized in the cytoplasm of the syncytiotrophoblast
        in the chorionic villi and in endometrial decidual cells at the uteroplacental
        interface. After week 10, the levels of trophinin, tastin, and bystin decreased
        and then disappeared from placental villi. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        cycle. Three alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different
        protein isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2010]


        DDX18: DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp
        (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases. They are implicated in a number of cellular
        processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation
        initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome
        assembly. Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family
        are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular
        growth and division. This gene encodes a DEAD box protein, and it is activated
        by Myc protein. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        SORD: Sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD; EC 1.1.1.14) catalyzes the interconversion
        of polyols and their corresponding ketoses, and together with aldose reductase
        (ALDR1; MIM 103880), makes up the sorbitol pathway that is believed to play
        an important role in the development of diabetic complications (summarized
        by Carr and Markham, 1995 [PubMed 8535074]). The first reaction of the pathway
        (also called the polyol pathway) is the reduction of glucose to sorbitol by
        ALDR1 with NADPH as the cofactor. SORD then oxidizes the sorbitol to fructose
        using NAD(+) cofactor.[supplied by OMIM, Jul 2010]

        CBX3: At the nuclear envelope, the nuclear lamina and heterochromatin are
        adjacent to the inner nuclear membrane. The protein encoded by this gene binds
        DNA and is a component of heterochromatin. This protein also can bind lamin
        B receptor, an integral membrane protein found in the inner nuclear membrane.
        The dual binding functions of the encoded protein may explain the association
        of heterochromatin with the inner nuclear membrane. This protein binds histone
        H3 tails methylated at Lys-9 sites. This protein is also recruited to sites
        of ultraviolet-induced DNA damage and double-strand breaks. Two transcript

        The encoded phosphoprotein shuttles between the nucleolus, nucleus, and cytoplasm,
        chaperoning ribosomal proteins and core histones from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
        This protein is also known to sequester the tumor suppressor ARF in the nucleolus,
        protecting it from degradation until it is needed. Mutations in this gene

        weak activity against dTTP and dATP, but none against dGTP. This protein may
        be responsible for eliminating excess dCTP after DNA synthesis and may prevent
        overmethylation of CpG islands. Three transcript variants, one protein-coding

        DNA replication. The encoded protein is a member of the MCM family of chromatin-binding
        proteins and can interact with at least two other members of this family.
        The encoded protein is upregulated in the transition from the G0 to G1/S phase
