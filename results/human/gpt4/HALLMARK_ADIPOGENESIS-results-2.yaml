          I will give you a list of human genes .
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          Provide results in the format

          Summary: <high level summary>
          Mechanism: <mechanism>
          Enriched Terms: <term1>; <term2>; <term3>

          For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number the list.
          Always put the list of terms last, after mechanism, summary, or hypotheses.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number the list.

          Summary and enriched terms:
        response_text: |2-
           Enrichment analysis of this list has revealed that many of the genes are involved in energy metabolism and fatty acid metabolism, such as ATP1B3, ACOX1, ACADM, SLC19A1, SLC25A10, PGM1, UCP2, GPX3 and GPX4. They are also related to adipogenesis, with genes such as ADIPOR2, APLP2, LEP, ADIG and ADIPOQ. Lastly, several of the genes are involved in cholesterol and bile acid synthesis, such as DHCR7, DHRS7, CYP4B1 and HMGCR.

          Mechanism: The genes identified as being involved in energy metabolism and fatty acid metabolism appear to share a common mechanism in which these molecules are generated from multiple sources to form energy. The genes involved in adipogenesis appear to be related to the regulation and development of fat cells and adipose tissue. Similarly, the genes involved in cholesterol and bile acid synthesis appear to be related to the synthesis of these molecules from multiple sources.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          Summary and enriched terms:
        response_text: |2-


          Summary: Several genes in the list encode proteins involved in the metabolism of fatty acids, including the formation and break down of lipids, synthesis of essential fatty acids, and transport of fatty acid synthase. Additionally, many of the genes encode proteins involved in the functioning of the mitochondria, including relating to the electron transport chains, antioxidant and redox systems, and synthesis of key metabolic components.

          Mechanism: The commonality among these genes is that they encode proteins essential for normal functioning of the mitochondria, oxidative metabolism of fuels, and lipid metabolism, all of which are important for normal cellular functioning and growth.

          Enriched Terms: Lipid Metabolism; Fatty Acid Synthesis; Electron Transport Chain; Mitochondria; Antioxidant; Oxidative Metabolism; Redox; Acyltransferase; Carboxylase; Acyl-Coenzyme A Synthetase; Ubiquitin Protease; Fructosyltransferase; Phospholipid; Oxidoreductase; Plasma Lipase; Hydratase.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number the list.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          Provide results in the format

          Summary: <high level summary>
          Mechanism: <mechanism>
          Enriched Terms: <term1>; <term2>; <term3>

          For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number the list.
          Always put the list of terms last, after mechanism, summary, or hypotheses.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.
