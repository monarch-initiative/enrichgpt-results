      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.


        Provide results in the format


        Summary: <high level summary>

        Mechanism: <mechanism>

        Enriched Terms: <term1>; <term2>; <term3>


        For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number
        the list.

        Always put the list of terms last, after mechanism, summary, or hypotheses.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger

        mechanism: the enriched terms suggest that the commonality in gene function
        is the involvement of cytokine receptors and signaling pathways'
      - particularly the jak-stat cascade
      - in cytokine-mediated signaling. this pathway is activated by cytokine binding
        to their respective receptors
      - leading to activation of the jak family of tyrosine kinases
      - which then phosphorylate and activate stat transcription factors to induce
        gene expression changes and cellular responses. the presence of these genes
        in the list suggests a potential role in regulating immune responses and inflammation
        through cytokine signaling

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        the recruitment of two anti-apoptotic proteins, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, which possess
        E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. The function of IAPs in TNF-receptor signalling
        is unknown, however, c-IAP1 is th...


        DNTT: This gene is a member of the DNA polymerase type-X family and encodes
        a template-independent DNA polymerase that catalyzes the addition of deoxynucleotides
        to the 3''-hydroxyl terminus of oligonucleotide primers. In vivo, the encoded
        protein is expressed in a restricted population of normal and malignant pre-B
        and pre-T lymphocytes during early...


        LEPR: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the gp130 family of cytokine
        receptors that are known to stimulate gene transcription via activation of
        cytosolic STAT proteins. This protein is a receptor for leptin (an adipocyte-specific
        hormone that regulates body weight), and is involved in the regulation of
        fat metabolism, as well as in a novel hematopoietic pathway that is required
        for normal lymphop...


        CD38: The protein encoded by this gene is a non-lineage-restricted, type II
        transmembrane glycoprotein that synthesizes and hydrolyzes cyclic adenosine
        5''-diphosphate-ribose, an intracellular calcium ion mobilizing messenger.
        The release of soluble protein and the ability of membrane-bound protein to
        become internalized indicate both extracellular and intracellular functions
        for the protein. This protein has an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail,...


        HMOX1: Heme oxygenase, an essential enzyme in heme catabolism, cleaves heme
        to form biliverdin, which is subsequently converted to bilirubin by biliverdin
        reductase, and carbon monoxide, a putative neurotransmitter. Heme oxygenase
        activity is induced by it...


        CSF1: The protein encoded by this gene is a cytokine that controls the production,
        differentiation, and function of macrophages. The active form of the protein
        is found extracellularly as a disulfide-linked homodimer, and is thought to
        be...


        IRF1: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional regulator and
        tumor suppressor, serving as an activator of genes involved in both innate
        and acquired immune responses. The encoded protein activates the transcription
        of genes involved in the body''s response to viruses and bacteria, playing
        a role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, the immune respons...


        IL15RA: This gene encodes a cytokine receptor that specifically binds interleukin
        15 (IL15) with high affinity. The receptors of IL15 and IL2 share two subunits,
        IL2R beta and IL2R gamma. This forms the basis of many overlapping biological
        activities of IL15 and IL2. The protein encoded by this gene is structurally
        related to IL2R alpha, an additional IL2-specific alpha subunit necessary
        for high affinity IL2 bi...

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.
