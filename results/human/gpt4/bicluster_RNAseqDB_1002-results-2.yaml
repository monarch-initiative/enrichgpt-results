          Here are the gene summaries:


          ACTA1: The product encoded by this gene belongs to the actin family of proteins, which are highly conserved proteins that play a role in cell motility, structure and integrity. Alpha, beta and gamma actin isoforms have been identified, with alpha actins being a major constituent of the contractile apparatus, while beta and gamma actins are involved in the regulation of cell motility. This actin is an alpha actin that is found in skeletal muscle. Mutations in this gene cause a variety of myopathies, including nemaline myopathy, congenital myopathy with excess of thin myofilaments, congenital myopathy with cores, and congenital myopathy with fiber-type disproportion, diseases that lead to muscle fiber defects with manifestations such as hypotonia. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2019]

          ASB10: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box-containing (ASB) family of proteins. The SOCS box serves to couple suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins and their binding partners with the elongin B and C complex, possibly targeting them for degradation. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2008]

          ASB5: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box-containing (ASB) family of proteins. They contain ankyrin repeat sequence and SOCS box domain.

Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene but their full length sequences are not known. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          C10orf71: Predicted to be involved in positive regulation of calcineurin-NFAT signaling cascade. Predicted to be located in Z disc. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          CAPN3: Calpain, a heterodimer consisting of a large and a small subunit, is a major intracellular protease, although its function has not been well established. This gene encodes a muscle-specific member of the calpain large subunit family that specifically binds to titin. Mutations in this gene are associated with limb-girdle muscular dystrophies type 2A. Alternate promoters and alternative splicing result in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms and some variants are ubiquitously expressed. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          CASQ1: This gene encodes the skeletal muscle specific member of the calsequestrin protein family. Calsequestrin functions as a luminal sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium sensor in both cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. This protein, also known as calmitine, functions as a calcium regulator in the mitochondria of skeletal muscle. This protein is absent in patients with Duchenne and Becker types of muscular dystrophy. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2013]

          CHRNA1: The muscle acetylcholine receptor consiststs of 5 subunits of 4 different types: 2 alpha subunits and 1 each of the beta, gamma, and delta subunits. This gene encodes an alpha subunit that plays a role in acetlycholine binding/channel gating. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2012]

          CKM: The protein encoded by this gene is a cytoplasmic enzyme involved in energy homeostasis and is an important serum marker for myocardial infarction. The encoded protein reversibly catalyzes the transfer of phosphate between ATP and various phosphogens such as creatine phosphate. It acts as a homodimer in striated muscle as well as in other tissues, and as a heterodimer with a similar brain isozyme in heart. The encoded protein is a member of the ATP:guanido phosphotransferase protein family. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          CMYA5: Predicted to enable identical protein binding activity.

          COX6A2: Cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, catalyzes the electron transfer from reduced cytochrome c to oxygen. It is a heteromeric complex consisting of 3 catalytic subunits encoded by mitochondrial genes and multiple structural subunits encoded by nuclear genes. The mitochondrially-encoded subunits function in electron transfer, and the nuclear-encoded subunits may be involved in the regulation and assembly of the complex. This nuclear gene encodes polypeptide 2 (heart/muscle isoform) of subunit VIa, and polypeptide 2 is present only in striated muscles. Polypeptide 1 (liver isoform) of subunit VIa is encoded by a different gene, and is found in all non-muscle tissues. These two polypeptides share 66% amino acid sequence identity. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

SCF complexes, formed by SKP1 (MIM 601434), cullin (see CUL1; MIM 603134), and F-box proteins, act as protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004 [PubMed 15520277]).[supplied by OMIM, Mar 2008]

Four sequence-related potassium channel genes - shaker, shaw, shab, and shal - have been identified in Drosophila, and each has been shown to have human homolog(s). This gene encodes a member of the potassium channel, voltage-gated, shaker-related subfamily. This member contains six membrane-spanning domains with a shaker-type repeat in the fourth segment. The gene is expressed preferentially in skeletal muscle, heart and kidney. It is a candidate gene for inherited cardiac disorders. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]

          MYBPC2: This gene encodes a member of the myosin-binding protein C family. This family includes the fast-, slow- and cardiac-type isoforms, each of which is a myosin-associated protein found in the cross-bridge-bearing zone (C region) of A bands in striated muscle. The protein encoded by this locus is referred to as the fast-type isoform. Mutations in the related but distinct genes encoding the slow-type and cardiac-type isoforms have been associated with distal arthrogryposis, type 1 and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, respectively. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2012]

          MYF6: The protein encoded by this gene is a probable basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) DNA binding protein involved in muscle differentiation. The encoded protein likely acts as a heterodimer with another bHLH protein. Defects in this gene are a cause of autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy (ADCNM). [provided by RefSeq, May 2010]

          MYH1: Myosin is a major contractile protein which converts chemical energy into mechanical energy through the hydrolysis of ATP. Myosin is a hexameric protein composed of a pair of myosin heavy chains (MYH) and two pairs of nonidentical light chains. Myosin heavy chains are encoded by a multigene family. In mammals at least 10 different myosin heavy chain (MYH) isoforms have been described from striated, smooth, and nonmuscle cells. These isoforms show expression that is spatially and temporally regulated during development. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          MYH2: Myosins are actin-based motor proteins that function in the generation of mechanical force in eukaryotic cells. Muscle myosins are heterohexamers composed of 2 myosin heavy chains and 2 pairs of nonidentical myosin light chains. This gene encodes a member of the class II or conventional myosin heavy chains, and functions in skeletal muscle contraction. This gene is found in a cluster of myosin heavy chain genes on chromosome 17. A mutation in this gene results in inclusion body myopathy-3. Multiple alternatively spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]

          MYH7: Muscle myosin is a hexameric protein containing 2 heavy chain subunits, 2 alkali light chain subunits, and 2 regulatory light chain subunits. This gene encodes the beta (or slow) heavy chain subunit of cardiac myosin. It is expressed predominantly in normal human ventricle. It is also expressed in skeletal muscle tissues rich in slow-twitch type I muscle fibers. Changes in the relative abundance of this protein and the alpha (or fast) heavy subunit of cardiac myosin correlate with the contractile velocity of cardiac muscle. Its expression is also altered during thyroid hormone depletion and hemodynamic overloading. Mutations in this gene are associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myosin storage myopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and Laing distal myopathy. [provided by RefSeq, May 2022]

          MYL1: Myosin is a hexameric ATPase cellular motor protein. It is composed of two heavy chains, two nonphosphorylatable alkali light chains, and two phosphorylatable regulatory light chains.

Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.[provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          MYPN: Striated muscle in vertebrates comprises large proteins which must be organized properly to contract efficiently. Z-lines in striated muscle are a sign of this organization, representing the ends of actin thin filaments, titin, nebulin or nebulette and accessory proteins required for structure and function. This gene encodes a protein which interacts with nebulin in skeletal muscle or nebulette in cardiac muscle and alpha-actinin. In addition, this gene product can interact with a protein with the I-band indicating it has a regulatory as well as structural function. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]

          NEB: This gene encodes nebulin, a giant protein component of the cytoskeletal matrix that coexists with the thick and thin filaments within the sarcomeres of skeletal muscle. In most vertebrates, nebulin accounts for 3 to 4% of the total myofibrillar protein. The encoded protein contains approximately 30-amino acid long modules that can be classified into 7 types and other repeated modules. Protein isoform sizes vary from 600 to 800 kD due to alternative splicing that is tissue-, species-,and developmental stage-specific. Of the 183 exons in the nebulin gene, at least 43 are alternatively spliced, although exons 143 and 144 are not found in the same transcript. Of the several thousand transcript variants predicted for nebulin, the RefSeq Project has decided to create three representative RefSeq records. Mutations in this gene are associated with recessive nemaline myopathy. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]

Predicted to be located in fascia adherens; muscle tendon junction; and myofibril. Predicted to be active in Z disc. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          PPP1R3A: The glycogen-associated form of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) derived from skeletal muscle is a heterodimer composed of a 37-kD catalytic subunit and a 124-kD targeting and regulatory subunit. This gene encodes the regulatory subunit which binds to muscle glycogen with high affinity, thereby enhancing dephosphorylation of glycogen-bound substrates for PP1 such as glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase kinase. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          PYGM: This gene encodes a muscle enzyme involved in glycogenolysis. Highly similar enzymes encoded by different genes are found in liver and brain. Mutations in this gene are associated with McArdle disease (myophosphorylase deficiency), a glycogen storage disease of muscle. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]

          RPL3L: This gene encodes a protein that shares sequence similarity with ribosomal protein L3. The protein belongs to the L3P family of ribosomal proteins. Unlike the ubiquitous expression of ribosomal protein genes, this gene has a tissue-specific pattern of expression, with the highest levels of expression in skeletal muscle and heart. It is not currently known whether the encoded protein is a functional ribosomal protein or whether it has evolved a function that is independent of the ribosome. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          SLC36A2: This gene encodes a pH-dependent proton-coupled amino acid transporter that belongs to the amino acid auxin permease 1 protein family. The encoded protein primarily transports small amino acids such as glycine, alanine and proline. Mutations in this gene are associated with iminoglycinuria and hyperglycinuria. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2010]

          SMPX: This gene encodes a small protein that has no known functional domains. Mutations in this gene are a cause of X-linked deafness-4, and the encoded protein may play a role in the maintenance of inner ear cells subjected to mechanical stress. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]

          TMOD4: Predicted to enable tropomyosin binding activity. Predicted to be involved in actin filament organization; muscle contraction; and myofibril assembly. Located in striated muscle thin filament. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          TNNC2: Troponin (Tn), a key protein complex in the regulation of striated muscle contraction, is composed of 3 subunits. The Tn-I subunit inhibits actomyosin ATPase, the Tn-T subunit binds tropomyosin and Tn-C, while the Tn-C subunit binds calcium and overcomes the inhibitory action of the troponin complex on actin filaments. The protein encoded by this gene is the Tn-C subunit. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          TNNI1: Troponin proteins associate with tropomyosin and regulate the calcium sensitivity of the myofibril contractile apparatus of striated muscles. Troponin I (TnI), along with troponin T (TnT) and troponin C (TnC), is one of 3 subunits that form the troponin complex of the thin filaments of striated muscle. TnI is the inhibitory subunit; blocking actin-myosin interactions and thereby mediating striated muscle relaxation. The TnI subfamily contains three genes: TnI-skeletal-fast-twitch, TnI-skeletal-slow-twitch, and TnI-cardiac. The TnI-fast and TnI-slow genes are expressed in fast-twitch and slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibers, respectively, while the TnI-cardiac gene is expressed exclusively in cardiac muscle tissue. This gene encodes the Troponin-I-skeletal-slow-twitch protein. This gene is expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle during early development but is restricted to slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibers in adults. The encoded protein prevents muscle contraction by inhibiting calcium-mediated conformational changes in actin-myosin complexes. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          TNNT1: This gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of troponin, which is a regulatory complex located on the thin filament of the sarcomere. This complex regulates striated muscle contraction in response to fluctuations in intracellular calcium concentration. This complex is composed of three subunits: troponin C, which binds calcium, troponin T, which binds tropomyosin, and troponin I, which is an inhibitory subunit. This protein is the slow skeletal troponin T subunit. Mutations in this gene cause nemaline myopathy type 5, also known as Amish nemaline myopathy, a neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness and rod-shaped, or nemaline, inclusions in skeletal muscle fibers which affects infants, resulting in death due to respiratory insufficiency, usually in the second year. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          TNNT3: The binding of Ca(2+) to the trimeric troponin complex initiates the process of muscle contraction. Increased Ca(2+) concentrations produce a conformational change in the troponin complex that is transmitted to tropomyosin dimers situated along actin filaments. The altered conformation permits increased interaction between a myosin head and an actin filament which, ultimately, produces a muscle contraction. The troponin complex has protein subunits C, I, and T. Subunit C binds Ca(2+) and subunit I binds to actin and inhibits actin-myosin interaction. Subunit T binds the troponin complex to the tropomyosin complex and is also required for Ca(2+)-mediated activation of actomyosin ATPase activity. There are 3 different troponin T genes that encode tissue-specific isoforms of subunit T for fast skeletal-, slow skeletal-, and cardiac-muscle. This gene encodes fast skeletal troponin T protein; also known as troponin T type 3. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding additional distinct troponin T type 3 isoforms. A developmentally regulated switch between fetal/neonatal and adult troponin T type 3 isoforms occurs. Additional splice variants have been described but their biological validity has not been established. Mutations in this gene may cause distal arthrogryposis multiplex congenita type 2B (DA2B). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2009]

          TRDN: This gene encodes an integral membrane protein found in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The encoded protein plays a role in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling as part of the calcium release complex and is required for normal skeletal muscle strength. This protein indirectly links triads and microtubules in skeletal muscle. Mutations in this gene are associated with cardiac arrythmia syndrome and some variants in this gene may be associated with sudden cardiac death. [provided by RefSeq, May 2022]

          TRIM63: This gene encodes a member of the RING zinc finger protein family found in striated muscle and iris. The product of this gene is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that localizes to the Z-line and M-line lattices of myofibrils. This protein plays an important role in the atrophy of skeletal and cardiac muscle and is required for the degradation of myosin heavy chain proteins, myosin light chain, myosin binding protein, and for muscle-type creatine kinase. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2012]

          TTN: This gene encodes a large abundant protein of striated muscle. The product of this gene is divided into two regions, a N-terminal I-band and a C-terminal A-band. The I-band, which is the elastic part of the molecule, contains two regions of tandem immunoglobulin domains on either side of a PEVK region that is rich in proline, glutamate, valine and lysine. The A-band, which is thought to act as a protein-ruler, contains a mixture of immunoglobulin and fibronectin repeats, and possesses kinase activity. An N-terminal Z-disc region and a C-terminal M-line region bind to the Z-line and M-line of the sarcomere, respectively, so that a single titin molecule spans half the length of a sarcomere. Titin also contains binding sites for muscle associated proteins so it serves as an adhesion template for the assembly of contractile machinery in muscle cells. It has also been identified as a structural protein for chromosomes. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. Considerable variability exists in the I-band, the M-line and the Z-disc regions of titin. Variability in the I-band region contributes to the differences in elasticity of different titin isoforms and, therefore, to the differences in elasticity of different muscle types. Mutations in this gene are associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 9, and autoantibodies to titin are produced in patients with the autoimmune disease scleroderma.

          XIRP2: Enables actin filament binding activity. Predicted to be involved in actin cytoskeleton organization and heart development. Predicted to act upstream of or within cardiac muscle tissue morphogenesis; cell-cell junction organization; and ventricular septum development. Colocalizes with focal adhesion and stress fiber.

The mitochondrially-encoded subunits function in electron transfer, and the nuclear-encoded subunits may be involved in the regulation and assembly of the complex. This nuclear gene encodes polypeptide 2 (heart/muscle isoform) of subunit VIa, and polypeptide 2 is present only in striated muscles. Polypeptide 1 (liver isoform) of subunit VIa is encoded by a different gene, and is found in all non-muscle tissues. These two polypeptides share 66% amino acid sequence identity.

These isoforms show expression that is spatially and temporally regulated during development. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          MYH2: Myosins are actin-based motor proteins that function in the generation of mechanical force in eukaryotic cells. Muscle myosins are heterohexamers composed of 2 myosin heavy chains and 2 pairs of nonidentical myosin light chains. This gene encodes a member of the class II or conventional myosin heavy chains, and functions in skeletal muscle contraction. This gene is found in a cluster of myosin heavy chain genes on chromosome 17. A mutation in this gene results in inclusion body myopathy-3. Multiple alternatively spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]

This gene encodes the beta (or slow) heavy chain subunit of cardiac myosin. It is expressed predominantly in normal human ventricle. It is also expressed in skeletal muscle tissues rich in slow-twitch type I muscle fibers. Changes in the relative abundance of this protein and the alpha (or fast) heavy subunit of cardiac myosin correlate with the contractile velocity of cardiac muscle. Its expression is also altered during thyroid hormone depletion and hemodynamic overloading. Mutations in this gene are associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myosin storage myopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and Laing distal myopathy. [provided by RefSeq, May 2022]

          MYL1: Myosin is a hexameric ATPase cellular motor protein. It is composed of two heavy chains, two nonphosphorylatable alkali light chains, and two phosphorylatable regulatory light chains.

          MYPN: Striated muscle in vertebrates comprises large proteins which must be organized properly to contract efficiently. Z-lines in striated muscle are a sign of this organization, representing the ends of actin thin filaments, titin, nebulin or nebulette and accessory proteins required for structure and function. This gene encodes a protein which interacts with nebulin in skeletal muscle or nebulette in cardiac muscle and alpha-actinin. In addition, this gene product can interact with a protein with the I-band indicating it has a regulatory as well as structural function. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]

          NEB: This gene encodes nebulin, a giant protein component of the cytoskeletal matrix that coexists with the thick and thin filaments within the sarcomeres of skeletal muscle. In most vertebrates, nebulin accounts for 3 to 4% of the total myofibrillar protein. The encoded protein contains approximately 30-amino acid long modules that can be classified into 7 types and other repeated modules. Protein isoform sizes vary from 600 to 800 kD due to alternative splicing that is tissue-, species-,and developmental stage-specific. Of the 183 exons in the nebulin gene, at least 43 are alternatively spliced, although exons 143 and 144 are not found in the same transcript. Of the several thousand transcript variants predicted for nebulin, the RefSeq Project has decided to create three representative RefSeq records. Mutations in this gene are associated with recessive nemaline myopathy. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]

          NMRK2: Enables ribosylnicotinamide kinase activity and ribosylnicotinate kinase activity. Predicted to be involved in NAD metabolic process. Predicted to act upstream of or within negative regulation of myoblast differentiation. Located in nucleoplasm and plasma membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

Predicted to be located in fascia adherens; muscle tendon junction; and myofibril. Predicted to be active in Z disc. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          PPP1R3A: The glycogen-associated form of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) derived from skeletal muscle is a heterodimer composed of a 37-kD catalytic subunit and a 124-kD targeting and regulatory subunit. This gene encodes the regulatory subunit which binds to muscle glycogen with high affinity, thereby enhancing dephosphorylation of glycogen-bound substrates for PP1 such as glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase kinase. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          PYGM: This gene encodes a muscle enzyme involved in glycogenolysis. Highly similar enzymes encoded by different genes are found in liver and brain. Mutations in this gene are associated with McArdle disease (myophosphorylase deficiency), a glycogen storage disease of muscle. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]

          RPL3L: This gene encodes a protein that shares sequence similarity with ribosomal protein L3. The protein belongs to the L3P family of ribosomal proteins. Unlike the ubiquitous expression of ribosomal protein genes, this gene has a tissue-specific pattern of expression, with the highest levels of expression in skeletal muscle and heart. It is not currently known whether the encoded protein is a functional ribosomal protein or whether it has evolved a function that is independent of the ribosome. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          SLC36A2: This gene encodes a pH-dependent proton-coupled amino acid transporter that belongs to the amino acid auxin permease 1 protein family. The encoded protein primarily transports small amino acids such as glycine, alanine and proline. Mutations in this gene are associated with iminoglycinuria and hyperglycinuria. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2010]

          SMPX: This gene encodes a small protein that has no known functional domains. Mutations in this gene are a cause of X-linked deafness-4, and the encoded protein may play a role in the maintenance of inner ear cells subjected to mechanical stress. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]

          TMOD4: Predicted to enable tropomyosin binding activity. Predicted to be involved in actin filament organization; muscle contraction; and myofibril assembly. Located in striated muscle thin filament. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          TNNC2: Troponin (Tn), a key protein complex in the regulation of striated muscle contraction, is composed of 3 subunits. The Tn-I subunit inhibits actomyosin ATPase, the Tn-T subunit binds tropomyosin and Tn-C, while the Tn-C subunit binds calcium and overcomes the inhibitory action of the troponin complex on actin filaments. The protein encoded by this gene is the Tn-C subunit. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          TNNI1: Troponin proteins associate with tropomyosin and regulate the calcium sensitivity of the myofibril contractile apparatus of striated muscles. Troponin I (TnI), along with troponin T (TnT) and troponin C (TnC), is one of 3 subunits that form the troponin complex of the thin filaments of striated muscle. TnI is the inhibitory subunit; blocking actin-myosin interactions and thereby mediating striated muscle relaxation. The TnI subfamily contains three genes: TnI-skeletal-fast-twitch, TnI-skeletal-slow-twitch, and TnI-cardiac. The TnI-fast and TnI-slow genes are expressed in fast-twitch and slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibers, respectively, while the TnI-cardiac gene is expressed exclusively in cardiac muscle tissue. This gene encodes the Troponin-I-skeletal-slow-twitch protein. This gene is expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle during early development but is restricted to slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibers in adults. The encoded protein prevents muscle contraction by inhibiting calcium-mediated conformational changes in actin-myosin complexes. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          TNNT1: This gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of troponin, which is a regulatory complex located on the thin filament of the sarcomere. This complex regulates striated muscle contraction in response to fluctuations in intracellular calcium concentration. This complex is composed of three subunits: troponin C, which binds calcium, troponin T, which binds tropomyosin, and troponin I, which is an inhibitory subunit. This protein is the slow skeletal troponin T subunit. Mutations in this gene cause nemaline myopathy type 5, also known as Amish nemaline myopathy, a neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness and rod-shaped, or nemaline, inclusions in skeletal muscle fibers which affects infants, resulting in death due to respiratory insufficiency, usually in the second year. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          TNNT3: The binding of Ca(2+) to the trimeric troponin complex initiates the process of muscle contraction. Increased Ca(2+) concentrations produce a conformational change in the troponin complex that is transmitted to tropomyosin dimers situated along actin filaments. The altered conformation permits increased interaction between a myosin head and an actin filament which, ultimately, produces a muscle contraction. The troponin complex has protein subunits C, I, and T. Subunit C binds Ca(2+) and subunit I binds to actin and inhibits actin-myosin interaction. Subunit T binds the troponin complex to the tropomyosin complex and is also required for Ca(2+)-mediated activation of actomyosin ATPase activity. There are 3 different troponin T genes that encode tissue-specific isoforms of subunit T for fast skeletal-, slow skeletal-, and cardiac-muscle. This gene encodes fast skeletal troponin T protein; also known as troponin T type 3. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding additional distinct troponin T type 3 isoforms. A developmentally regulated switch between fetal/neonatal and adult troponin T type 3 isoforms occurs. Additional splice variants have been described but their biological validity has not been established. Mutations in this gene may cause distal arthrogryposis multiplex congenita type 2B (DA2B). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2009]

          TRDN: This gene encodes an integral membrane protein found in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The encoded protein plays a role in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling as part of the calcium release complex and is required for normal skeletal muscle strength. This protein indirectly links triads and microtubules in skeletal muscle. Mutations in this gene are associated with cardiac arrythmia syndrome and some variants in this gene may be associated with sudden cardiac death. [provided by RefSeq, May 2022]

          TRIM63: This gene encodes a member of the RING zinc finger protein family found in striated muscle and iris. The product of this gene is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that localizes to the Z-line and M-line lattices of myofibrils. This protein plays an important role in the atrophy of skeletal and cardiac muscle and is required for the degradation of myosin heavy chain proteins, myosin light chain, myosin binding protein, and for muscle-type creatine kinase. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2012]

          TTN: This gene encodes a large abundant protein of striated muscle. The product of this gene is divided into two regions, a N-terminal I-band and a C-terminal A-band. The I-band, which is the elastic part of the molecule, contains two regions of tandem immunoglobulin domains on either side of a PEVK region that is rich in proline, glutamate, valine and lysine. The A-band, which is thought to act as a protein-ruler, contains a mixture of immunoglobulin and fibronectin repeats, and possesses kinase activity. An N-terminal Z-disc region and a C-terminal M-line region bind to the Z-line and M-line of the sarcomere, respectively, so that a single titin molecule spans half the length of a sarcomere. Titin also contains binding sites for muscle associated proteins so it serves as an adhesion template for the assembly of contractile machinery in muscle cells. It has also been identified as a structural protein for chromosomes. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. Considerable variability exists in the I-band, the M-line and the Z-disc regions of titin. Variability in the I-band region contributes to the differences in elasticity of different titin isoforms and, therefore, to the differences in elasticity of different muscle types. Mutations in this gene are associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 9, and autoantibodies to titin are produced in patients with the autoimmune disease scleroderma.

          XIRP2: Enables actin filament binding activity. Predicted to be involved in actin cytoskeleton organization and heart development. Predicted to act upstream of or within cardiac muscle tissue morphogenesis; cell-cell junction organization; and ventricular septum development. Colocalizes with focal adhesion and stress fiber.

          TNNI1: Troponin proteins associate with tropomyosin and regulate the calcium sensitivity of the myofibril contractile apparatus of striated muscles. Troponin I (TnI), along with troponin T (TnT) and troponin C (TnC), is one of 3 subunits that form the troponin complex of the thin filaments of striated muscle. TnI is the inhibitory subunit; blocking actin-myosin interactions and thereby mediating striated muscle relaxation. The TnI subfamily contains three genes: TnI-skeletal-fast-twitch, TnI-skeletal-slow-twitch, and TnI-cardiac. The TnI-fast and TnI-slow gen...

          TNNT1: This gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of troponin, which is a regulatory complex located on the thin filament of the sarcomere.

This protein is the slow skeletal troponin T subu...

          TNNT3: The binding of Ca(2+) to the trimeric troponin complex initiates the process of muscle contraction. Increased Ca(2+) concentrations produce a conformational change in the troponin complex that is transmitted to tropomyosin dimers situated along actin filaments. The altered conformation permits increased interaction between a myosin head and an actin filament which, ultimately, produces a muscle contraction. The troponin complex has protein subunits C, I, and T. Subunit C binds Ca(2+) and subunit I binds to actin and inhibits actin-myosin interaction. Subunit T binds the troponin complex to the tropomyosin complex and is also required for Ca(2+)-mediated activation of actomyosin ATPase activity. Th...

          TTN: This gene encodes a large abundant protein of striated muscle. The product of this gene is divided into two regions, a N-terminal I-band and a C-terminal A-band. The I-band, which is the elastic part of the molecule, contains two regions of tandem immunoglobulin domains on either side of a PEVK region that is rich in proline, glutamate, valine and lysine. The A-band, which is thought to act as a protein-ruler, contains a mixture of immunoglobulin and fibronectin repeats, and possesses kinase activity.

          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          TNNT3: The binding of Ca(2+) to the trimeric troponin complex initiates the process of muscle contraction. Increased Ca(2+) concentrations produce a conformational change in the troponin complex that is transmitted to tropomyosin dimers situated along actin filaments. The altered conformation permits increased interaction between a myosin head and an actin filament which, ultimately, produces a muscle contraction. The troponin complex has protein subunits C, I, and T. Subunit C binds Ca(2+) and subunit I binds to actin and inhibits actin-myosin interaction. Subunit T binds the troponin complex to the tropomyosin complex and is also required for Ca(2+)-mediated activation of actomyosin ATPase activity. Th...

          Here are the gene summaries:


          PPP1R3A: The glycogen-associated form of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) derived from skeletal muscle is a heterodimer composed of a 37-kD catalytic subunit and a 124-kD targeting and regulatory subunit. This gene encodes the regulatory subunit which binds to muscle glycogen with high affinity, thereby enhancing dephosphorylation of glycogen-bound substrates for PP1 such as glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase kinase. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          MYOT: This gene encodes a cystoskeletal protein which plays a significant role in the stability of thin filaments during muscle contraction. This protein binds F-actin, crosslinks actin filaments, and prevents latrunculin A-induced filament disassembly. Mutations in this gene have been associated with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and myofibrillar myopathies. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.[provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          TNNT1: This gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of troponin, which is a regulatory complex located on the thin filament of the sarcomere. This complex regulates striated muscle contraction in response to fluctuations in intracellular calcium concentration. This complex is composed of three subunits: troponin C, which binds calcium, troponin T, which binds tropomyosin, and troponin I, which is an inhibitory subunit. This protein is the slow skeletal troponin T subunit. Mutations in this gene cause nemaline myopathy type 5, also known as Amish nemaline myopathy, a neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness and rod-shaped, or nemaline, inclusions in skeletal muscle fibers which affects infants, resulting in death due to respiratory insufficiency, usually in the second year. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          KLHL40: This gene encodes a protein containing a BACK domain, a BTB/POZ domain, and 5 Kelch repeats, however, its exact function is not known. The gene and the multi-domain protein structure are conserved across different taxa, including primates, rodents, chicken and zebrafish. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2012]

          TRIM63: This gene encodes a member of the RING zinc finger protein family found in striated muscle and iris. The product of this gene is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that localizes to the Z-line and M-line lattices of myofibrils. This protein plays an important role in the atrophy of skeletal and cardiac muscle and is required for the degradation of myosin heavy chain proteins, myosin light chain, myosin binding protein, and for muscle-type creatine kinase. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2012]

          MYH1: Myosin is a major contractile protein which converts chemical energy into mechanical energy through the hydrolysis of ATP. Myosin is a hexameric protein composed of a pair of myosin heavy chains (MYH) and two pairs of nonidentical light chains. Myosin heavy chains are encoded by a multigene family. In mammals at least 10 different myosin heavy chain (MYH) isoforms have been described from striated, smooth, and nonmuscle cells. These isoforms show expression that is spatially and temporally regulated during development. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          CAPN3: Calpain, a heterodimer consisting of a large and a small subunit, is a major intracellular protease, although its function has not been well established. This gene encodes a muscle-specific member of the calpain large subunit family that specifically binds to titin. Mutations in this gene are associated with limb-girdle muscular dystrophies type 2A. Alternate promoters and alternative splicing result in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms and some variants are ubiquitously expressed. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          ASB10: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box-containing (ASB) family of proteins. The SOCS box serves to couple suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins and their binding partners with the elongin B and C complex, possibly targeting them for degradation. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2008]

          CASQ1: This gene encodes the skeletal muscle specific member of the calsequestrin protein family. Calsequestrin functions as a luminal sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium sensor in both cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. This protein, also known as calmitine, functions as a calcium regulator in the mitochondria of skeletal muscle. This protein is absent in patients with Duchenne and Becker types of muscular dystrophy. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2013]

          ACTA1: The product encoded by this gene belongs to the actin family of proteins, which are highly conserved proteins that play a role in cell motility, structure and integrity. Alpha, beta and gamma actin isoforms have been identified, with alpha actins being a major constituent of the contractile apparatus, while beta and gamma actins are involved in the regulation of cell motility. This actin is an alpha actin that is found in skeletal muscle. Mutations in this gene cause a variety of myopathies, including nemaline myopathy, congenital myopathy with excess of thin myofilaments, congenital myopathy with cores, and congenital myopathy with fiber-type disproportion, diseases that lead to muscle fiber defects with manifestations such as hypotonia. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2019]

          C10orf71: Predicted to be involved in positive regulation of calcineurin-NFAT signaling cascade. Predicted to be located in Z disc. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          MYH2: Myosins are actin-based motor proteins that function in the generation of mechanical force in eukaryotic cells. Muscle myosins are heterohexamers composed of 2 myosin heavy chains and 2 pairs of nonidentical myosin light chains. This gene encodes a member of the class II or conventional myosin heavy chains, and functions in skeletal muscle contraction. This gene is found in a cluster of myosin heavy chain genes on chromosome 17. A mutation in this gene results in inclusion body myopathy-3. Multiple alternatively spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]

          KCNA7: Potassium channels represent the most complex class of voltage-gated ion channels from both functional and structural standpoints. Their diverse functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin secretion, neuronal excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth muscle contraction, and cell volume. Four sequence-related potassium channel genes - shaker, shaw, shab, and shal - have been identified in Drosophila, and each has been shown to have human homolog(s). This gene encodes a member of the potassium channel, voltage-gated, shaker-related subfamily. This member contains six membrane-spanning domains with a shaker-type repeat in the fourth segment. The gene is expressed preferentially in skeletal muscle, heart and kidney. It is a candidate gene for inherited cardiac disorders. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          MYPN: Striated muscle in vertebrates comprises large proteins which must be organized properly to contract efficiently. Z-lines in striated muscle are a sign of this organization, representing the ends of actin thin filaments, titin, nebulin or nebulette and accessory proteins required for structure and function. This gene encodes a protein which interacts with nebulin in skeletal muscle or nebulette in cardiac muscle and alpha-actinin. In addition, this gene product can interact with a protein with the I-band indicating it has a regulatory as well as structural function. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]

          CKM: The protein encoded by this gene is a cytoplasmic enzyme involved in energy homeostasis and is an important serum marker for myocardial infarction. The encoded protein reversibly catalyzes the transfer of phosphate between ATP and various phosphogens such as creatine phosphate. It acts as a homodimer in striated muscle as well as in other tissues, and as a heterodimer with a similar brain isozyme in heart. The encoded protein is a member of the ATP:guanido phosphotransferase protein family. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          MYL1: Myosin is a hexameric ATPase cellular motor protein. It is composed of two heavy chains, two nonphosphorylatable alkali light chains, and two phosphorylatable regulatory light chains. This gene encodes a myosin alkali light chain expressed in fast skeletal muscle. Two transcript variants have been identified for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          SLC36A2: This gene encodes a pH-dependent proton-coupled amino acid transporter that belongs to the amino acid auxin permease 1 protein family.

[provided by RefSeq, Sep 2010]

          TTN: This gene encodes a large abundant protein of striated muscle. The product of this gene is divided into two regions, a N-terminal I-band and a C-terminal A-band. The I-band, which is the elastic part of the molecule, contains two regions of tandem immunoglobulin domains on either side of a PEVK region that is rich in proline, glutamate, valine and lysine. The A-band, which is thought to act as a protein-ruler, contains a mixture of immunoglobulin and fibronectin repeats, and possesses kinase activity. An N-terminal Z-disc region and a C-terminal M-line region bind to the Z-line and M-line of the sarcomere, respectively, so that a single titin molecule spans half the length of a sarcomere. Titin also contains binding sites for muscle associated proteins so it serves as an adhesion template for the assembly of contractile machinery in muscle cells. It has also been identified as a structural protein for chromosomes. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. Considerable variability exists in the I-band, the M-line and the Z-disc regions of titin. Variability in the I-band region contributes to the differences in elasticity of different titin isoforms and, therefore, to the differences in elasticity of different muscle types. Mutations in this gene are associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 9, and autoantibodies to titin are produced in patients with the autoimmune disease scleroderma.

          NEB: This gene encodes nebulin, a giant protein component of the cytoskeletal matrix that coexists with the thick and thin filaments within the sarcomeres of skeletal muscle. In most vertebrates, nebulin accounts for 3 to 4% of the total myofibrillar protein. The encoded protein contains approximately 30-amino acid long modules that can be classified into 7 types and other repeated modules. Protein isoform sizes vary from 600 to 800 kD due to alternative splicing that is tissue-, species-,and developmental stage-specific. Of the 183 exons in the nebulin gene, at least 43 are alternatively spliced, although exons 143 and 144 are not found in the same transcript. Of the several thousand transcript variants predicted for nebulin, the RefSeq Project has decided to create three representative RefSeq records. Mutations in this gene are associated with recessive nemaline myopathy. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]

Mutations in this gene are thought to cause heritable forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in humans. Alternatively spliced transcript variants with different 5' UTR, but encoding the same protein, have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          ASB5: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box-containing (ASB) family of proteins. They contain ankyrin repeat sequence and SOCS box domain. The SOCS box serves to couple suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins and their binding partners with the elongin B and C complex, possibly targeting them for degradation.

          MYBPC1: This gene encodes a member of the myosin-binding protein C family. Myosin-binding protein C family members are myosin-associated proteins found in the cross-bridge-bearing zone (C region) of A bands in striated muscle. The encoded protein is the slow skeletal muscle isoform of myosin-binding protein C and plays an important role in muscle contraction by recruiting muscle-type creatine kinase to myosin filaments.

[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]

          RPL3L: This gene encodes a protein that shares sequence similarity with ribosomal protein L3. The protein belongs to the L3P family of ribosomal proteins. Unlike the ubiquitous expression of ribosomal protein genes, this gene has a tissue-specific pattern of expression, with the highest levels of expression in skeletal muscle and heart. It is not currently known whether the encoded protein is a functional ribosomal protein or whether it has evolved a function that is independent of the ribosome. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          PYGM: This gene encodes a muscle enzyme involved in glycogenolysis. Highly similar enzymes encoded by different genes are found in liver and brain.

SCF complexes, formed by SKP1 (MIM 601434), cullin (see CUL1; MIM 603134), and F-box proteins, act as protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004 [PubMed 15520277]).[supplied by OMIM, Mar 2008]

          XIRP2: Enables actin filament binding activity. Predicted to be involved in actin cytoskeleton organization and heart development.

[provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          TNNI1: Troponin proteins associate with tropomyosin and regulate the calcium sensitivity of the myofibril contractile apparatus of striated muscles. Troponin I (TnI), along with troponin T (TnT) and troponin C (TnC), is one of 3 subunits that form the troponin complex of the thin filaments of striated muscle. TnI is the inhibitory subunit; blocking actin-myosin interactions and thereby mediating striated muscle relaxation. The TnI subfamily contains three genes: TnI-skeletal-fast-twitch, TnI-skeletal-slow-twitch, and TnI-cardiac. The TnI-fast and TnI-slow genes are expressed in fast-twitch and slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibers, respectively, while the TnI-cardiac gene is expressed exclusively in cardiac muscle tissue. This gene encodes the Troponin-I-skeletal-slow-twitch protein. This gene is expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle during early development but is restricted to slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibers in adults. The encoded protein prevents muscle contraction by inhibiting calcium-mediated conformational changes in actin-myosin complexes. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

[provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          MYH7: Muscle myosin is a hexameric protein containing 2 heavy chain subunits, 2 alkali light chain subunits, and 2 regulatory light chain subunits. This gene encodes the beta (or slow) heavy chain subunit of cardiac myosin. It is expressed predominantly in normal human ventricle. It is also expressed in skeletal muscle tissues rich in slow-twitch type I muscle fibers. Changes in the relative abundance of this protein and the alpha (or fast) heavy subunit of cardiac myosin correlate with the contractile velocity of cardiac muscle. Its expression is also altered during thyroid hormone depletion and hemodynamic overloading. Mutations in this gene are associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myosin storage myopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and Laing distal myopathy. [provided by RefSeq, May 2022]

          COX6A2: Cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, catalyzes the electron transfer from reduced cytochrome c to oxygen. It is a heteromeric complex consisting of 3 catalytic subunits encoded by mitochondrial genes and multiple structural subunits encoded by nuclear genes. The mitochondrially-encoded subunits function in electron transfer, and the nuclear-encoded subunits may be involved in the regulation and assembly of the complex. This nuclear gene encodes polypeptide 2 (heart/muscle isoform) of subunit VIa, and polypeptide 2 is present only in striated muscles. Polypeptide 1 (liver isoform) of subunit VIa is encoded by a different gene, and is found in all non-muscle tissues. These two polypeptides share 66% amino acid sequence identity. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          TNNT3: The binding of Ca(2+) to the trimeric troponin complex initiates the process of muscle contraction. Increased Ca(2+) concentrations produce a conformational change in the troponin complex that is transmitted to tropomyosin dimers situated along actin filaments. The altered conformation permits increased interaction between a myosin head and an actin filament which, ultimately, produces a muscle contraction. The troponin complex has protein subunits C, I, and T. Subunit C binds Ca(2+) and subunit I binds to actin and inhibits actin-myosin interaction. Subunit T binds the troponin complex to the tropomyosin complex and is also required for Ca(2+)-mediated activation of actomyosin ATPase activity. There are 3 different troponin T genes that encode tissue-specific isoforms of subunit T for fast skeletal-, slow skeletal-, and cardiac-muscle. This gene encodes fast skeletal troponin T protein; also known as troponin T type 3. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding additional distinct troponin T type 3 isoforms. A developmentally regulated switch between fetal/neonatal and adult troponin T type 3 isoforms occurs. Additional splice variants have been described but their biological validity has not been established. Mutations in this gene may cause distal arthrogryposis multiplex congenita type 2B (DA2B).

This protein is the slow skeletal troponin T subunit. Mutations in this gene cause nemaline myopathy type 5, also known as Amish nemaline myopathy, a neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness and rod-shaped, or nemaline, inclusions in skeletal muscle fibers which affects infants, resulting in death due to respiratory insufficiency, usually in the second year.

Muscle myosins are heterohexamers composed of 2 myosin heavy chains and 2 pairs of nonidentical myosin light chains. This gene encodes a member of the class II or conventional myosin heavy chains, and functions in skeletal muscle contraction. This gene is found in a cluster of myosin heavy chain genes on chromosome 17. A mutation in this gene results in inclusion body myopathy-3. Multiple alternatively spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]

          KCNA7: Potassium channels represent the most complex class of voltage-gated ion channels from both functional and structural standpoints. Their diverse functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin secretion, neuronal excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth muscle contraction, and cell volume. Four sequence-related potassium channel genes - shaker, shaw, shab, and shal - have been identified in Drosophila, and each has been shown to have human homolog(s).

          MYPN: Striated muscle in vertebrates comprises large proteins which must be organized properly to contract efficiently. Z-lines in striated muscle are a sign of this organization, representing the ends of actin thin filaments, titin, nebulin or nebulette and accessory proteins required for structure and function. This gene encodes a protein which interacts with nebulin in skeletal muscle or nebulette in cardiac muscle and alpha-actinin. In addition, this gene product can interact with a protein with the I-band indicating it has a regulatory as well as structural function. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

          CKM: The protein encoded by this gene is a cytoplasmic enzyme involved in energy homeostasis and is an important serum marker for myocardial infarction. The encoded protein reversibly catalyzes the transfer of phosphate between ATP and various phosphogens such as creatine phosphate. It acts as a homodimer in striated muscle as well as in other tissues, and as a heterodimer with a similar brain isozyme in heart. The encoded protein is a member of the ATP:guanido phosphotransferase protein family. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          MYL1: Myosin is a hexameric ATPase cellular motor protein. It is composed of two heavy chains, two nonphosphorylatable alkali light chains, and two phosphorylatable regulatory light chains.

[provided by RefSeq, Sep 2010]

          TTN: This gene encodes a large abundant protein of striated muscle. The product of this gene is divided into two regions, a N-terminal I-band and a C-terminal A-band. The I-band, which is the elastic part of the molecule, contains two regions of tandem immunoglobulin domains on either side of a PEVK region that is rich in proline, glutamate, valine and lysine. The A-band, which is thought to act as a protein-ruler, contains a mixture of immunoglobulin and fibronectin repeats, and possesses kinase activity. An N-terminal Z-disc region and a C-terminal M-line region bind to the Z-line and M-line of the sarcomere, respectively, so that a single titin molecule spans half the length of a sarcomere. Titin also contains binding sites for muscle associated proteins so it serves as an adhesion template for the assembly of contractile machinery in muscle cells. It has also been identified as a structural protein for chromosomes. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. Considerable variability exists in the I-band, the M-line and the Z-disc regions of titin. Variability in the I-band region contributes to the differences in elasticity of different titin isoforms and, therefore, to the differences in elasticity of different muscle types. Mutations in this gene are associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 9, and autoantibodies to titin are produced in patients with the autoimmune disease scleroderma.

          NEB: This gene encodes nebulin, a giant protein component of the cytoskeletal matrix that coexists with the thick and thin filaments within the sarcomeres of skeletal muscle. In most vertebrates, nebulin accounts for 3 to 4% of the total myofibrillar protein. The encoded protein contains approximately 30-amino acid long modules that can be classified into 7 types and other repeated modules. Protein isoform sizes vary from 600 to 800 kD due to alternative splicing that is tissue-, species-,and developmental stage-specific. Of the 183 exons in the nebulin gene, at least 43 are alternatively spliced, although exons 143 and 144 are not found in the same transcript. Of the several thousand transcript variants predicted for nebulin, the RefSeq Project has decided to create three representative RefSeq records. Mutations in this gene are associated with recessive nemaline myopathy. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]

Mutations in this gene are thought to cause heritable forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in humans. Alternatively spliced transcript variants with different 5' UTR, but encoding the same protein, have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          ASB5: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box-containing (ASB) family of proteins. They contain ankyrin repeat sequence and SOCS box domain. The SOCS box serves to couple suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins and their binding partners with the elongin B and C complex, possibly targeting them for degradation. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene but their full length sequences are not known. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          MYBPC1: This gene encodes a member of the myosin-binding protein C family. Myosin-binding protein C family members are myosin-associated proteins found in the cross-bridge-bearing zone (C region) of A bands in striated muscle. The encoded protein is the slow skeletal muscle isoform of myosin-binding protein C and plays an important role in muscle contraction by recruiting muscle-type creatine kinase to myosin filaments. Mutations in this gene are associated with distal arthrogryposis type I. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]

          RPL3L: This gene encodes a protein that shares sequence similarity with ribosomal protein L3. The protein belongs to the L3P family of ribosomal proteins. Unlike the ubiquitous expression of ribosomal protein genes, this gene has a tissue-specific pattern of expression, with the highest levels of expression in skeletal muscle and heart. It is not currently known whether the encoded protein is a functional ribosomal protein or whether it has evolved a function that is independent of the ribosome. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          PYGM: This gene encodes a muscle enzyme involved in glycogenolysis. Highly similar enzymes encoded by different genes are found in liver and brain. Mutations in this gene are associated with McArdle disease (myophosphorylase deficiency), a glycogen storage disease of muscle. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]

          FBXO40: Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXO40, are characterized by an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by SKP1 (MIM 601434), cullin (see CUL1; MIM 603134), and F-box proteins, act as protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004 [PubMed 15520277]).[supplied by OMIM, Mar 2008]

          XIRP2: Enables actin filament binding activity. Predicted to be involved in actin cytoskeleton organization and heart development. Predicted to act upstream of or within cardiac muscle tissue morphogenesis; cell-cell junction organization; and ventricular septum development. Colocalizes with focal adhesion and stress fiber. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          TNNI1: Troponin proteins associate with tropomyosin and regulate the calcium sensitivity of the myofibril contractile apparatus of striated muscles. Troponin I (TnI), along with troponin T (TnT) and troponin C (TnC), is one of 3 subunits that form the troponin complex of the thin filaments of striated muscle. TnI is the inhibitory subunit; blocking actin-myosin interactions and thereby mediating striated muscle relaxation. The TnI subfamily contains three genes: TnI-skeletal-fast-twitch, TnI-skeletal-slow-twitch, and TnI-cardiac. The TnI-fast and TnI-slow genes are expressed in fast-twitch and slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibers, respectively, while the TnI-cardiac gene is expressed exclusively in cardiac muscle tissue. This gene encodes the Troponin-I-skeletal-slow-twitch protein. This gene is expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle during early development but is restricted to slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibers in adults. The encoded protein prevents muscle contraction by inhibiting calcium-mediated conformational changes in actin-myosin complexes. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          CHRNA1: The muscle acetylcholine receptor consiststs of 5 subunits of 4 different types: 2 alpha subunits and 1 each of the beta, gamma, and delta subunits. This gene encodes an alpha subunit that plays a role in acetlycholine binding/channel gating. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2012]

          CMYA5: Predicted to enable identical protein binding activity. Predicted to act upstream of or within negative regulation of calcineurin-NFAT signaling cascade; negative regulation of phosphoprotein phosphatase activity; and regulation of skeletal muscle adaptation. Located in cytosol; nuclear speck; and plasma membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          MRGPRX2: Enables G protein-coupled receptor activity and neuropeptide binding activity. Involved in mast cell degranulation and positive regulation of cytokinesis. Predicted to be integral component of membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          MYF6: The protein encoded by this gene is a probable basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) DNA binding protein involved in muscle differentiation. The encoded protein likely acts as a heterodimer with another bHLH protein. Defects in this gene are a cause of autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy (ADCNM). [provided by RefSeq, May 2010]

          MYOM3: Predicted to enable actin filament binding activity and protein homodimerization activity. Predicted to be involved in muscle contraction. Predicted to be active in M band. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          LMOD2: Enables actin monomer binding activity and tropomyosin binding activity. Involved in actin nucleation; positive regulation of actin filament polymerization; and sarcomere organization. Located in actin filament and sarcomere. Colocalizes with M band. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          MYH7: Muscle myosin is a hexameric protein containing 2 heavy chain subunits, 2 alkali light chain subunits, and 2 regulatory light chain subunits. This gene encodes the beta (or slow) heavy chain subunit of cardiac myosin. It is expressed predominantly in normal human ventricle. It is also expressed in skeletal muscle tissues rich in slow-twitch type I muscle fibers. Changes in the relative abundance of this protein and the alpha (or fast) heavy subunit of cardiac myosin correlate with the contractile velocity of cardiac muscle. Its expression is also altered during thyroid hormone depletion and hemodynamic overloading. Mutations in this gene are associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myosin storage myopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and Laing distal myopathy. [provided by RefSeq, May 2022]

          COX6A2: Cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, catalyzes the electron transfer from reduced cytochrome c to oxygen. It is a heteromeric complex consisting of 3 catalytic subunits encoded by mitochondrial genes and multiple structural subunits encoded by nuclear genes. The mitochondrially-encoded subunits function in electron transfer, and the nuclear-encoded subunits may be involved in the regulation and assembly of the complex. This nuclear gene encodes polypeptide 2 (heart/muscle isoform) of subunit VIa, and polypeptide 2 is present only in striated muscles. Polypeptide 1 (liver isoform) of subunit VIa is encoded by a different gene, and is found in all non-muscle tissues. These two polypeptides share 66% amino acid sequence identity. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          TNNT3: The binding of Ca(2+) to the trimeric troponin complex initiates the process of muscle contraction. Increased Ca(2+) concentrations produce a conformational change in the troponin complex that is transmitted to tropomyosin dimers situated along actin filaments. The altered conformation permits increased interaction between a myosin head and an actin filament which, ultimately, produces a muscle contraction. The troponin complex has protein subunits C, I, and T. Subunit C binds Ca(2+) and subunit I binds to actin and inhibits actin-myosin interaction. Subunit T binds the troponin complex to the tropomyosin complex and is also required for Ca(2+)-mediated activation of actomyosin ATPase activity. There are 3 different troponin T genes that encode tissue-specific isoforms of subunit T for fast skeletal-, slow skeletal-, and cardiac-muscle. This gene encodes fast skeletal troponin T protein; also known as troponin T type 3. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding additional distinct troponin T type 3 isoforms. A developmentally regulated switch between fetal/neonatal and adult troponin T type 3 isoforms occurs. Additional splice variants have been described but their biological validity has not been established. Mutations in this gene may cause distal arthrogryposis multiplex congenita type 2B (DA2B).

          MYOG: Myogenin is a muscle-specific transcription factor that can induce myogenesis in a variety of cell types in tissue culture. It is a member of a large family of proteins related by sequence homology, the helix-loop-helix (HLH) proteins. It is essential for the development of functional skeletal muscle. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          MYBPC2: This gene encodes a member of the myosin-binding protein C family. This family includes the fast-, slow- and cardiac-type isoforms, each of which is a myosin-associated protein found in the cross-bridge-bearing zone (C region) of A bands in striated muscle. The protein encoded by this locus is referred to as the fast-type isoform. Mutations in the related but distinct genes encoding the slow-type and cardiac-type isoforms have been associated with distal arthrogryposis, type 1 and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, respectively. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2012]

          SMPX: This gene encodes a small protein that has no known functional domains. Mutations in this gene are a cause of X-linked deafness-4, and the encoded protein may play a role in the maintenance of inner ear cells subjected to mechanical stress. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]

        response_text: |2-
           The list of genes is highly enriched for those involved in the regulation and control of muscle contraction, including functions related to actin and myosin, troponin and tropomyosin complexes, and the cross-bridge formation between the two proteins. Genes related to the calcium sensitivity of the muscle and energy homeostasis were also represented.

          Mechanism: These genes appear to be involved in the intricate regulation of the muscle contraction process, enabling calcium sensitivity and movement of actin and myosin filaments in the sarcomere. This is accomplished through the presence of myosin-binding proteins, calcium-sensing molecules, G protein-coupled receptors, and proteins that bind actin and tropomyosin. These protective and structural molecules facilitate the movement of the filaments in the sarcomere, and the regulation of muscle contraction.
