          Summary: Several of the genes listed are involved in transport functions and enzyme activities related to lipid and fatty acid metabolism. Additionally, some genes are involved in binding and catalytic functions related to retinoids and steroids.

          Enriched Terms: lipid metabolism; fatty acid metabolism; transport; enzyme activity; retinoid binding; steroid binding.

          Mechanism and Hypothesis: These genes are involved in several functions that are key to cellular metabolism and homeostasis. Lipid and fatty acid metabolism are essential for maintaining membrane integrity and cellular signaling processes. Transporters and enzymes related to these functions are necessary for proper uptake, utilization, and metabolism of lipids and fatty acids. Additionally, retinoids and steroids are important signaling molecules that can be involved in metabolic processes and cellular differentiation. The presence of these genes suggests that dysregulation of lipid, fatty acid, retinoid, or steroid metabolism could lead to disease states such as metabolic disorders, cancer, or developmental abnormalities.

          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.

          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"

          Summary and enriched terms:
        response_text: |2-

          The summary of these genes is that they are all associated with either an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, an antioxidant enzyme, a hormone binding protein, a nuclear receptor transcription factor, a fatty acid desaturase, a carnitine acyltransferase, an isocalate dehydrogenase, a peroxisomal membrane protein, or a flavin adenine dinecleotide (FAD)-dependent oxidoreductase. The most enriched terms are: ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, antioxidant enzyme, hormone binding protein, nuclear receptor transcription factor, fatty acid desaturase, carnitine acyltransferase, isocalate dehydrogenase, peroxisomal membrane protein, and FAD-dependent oxidoreductase.

          Mechanism: Many of the genes are involved in regulating the production and movement of lipids and fatty acids, as well as the synthesis of hormones, corticosteroids, and signalling receptors. The underlying biological mechanism is that these genes act as regulators of metabolic pathways, ensuring that their respective pathways are functioning correctly and that metabolites are transported correctly.

          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.

          Summary: The enriched terms for the given list of genes suggest involvement in lipid metabolism, peroxisome function, and detoxification processes.

          Enriched Terms: fatty acid metabolism; peroxisome; lipid binding activity; detoxification; acyl-CoA ligase activity.

          Mechanism: These genes are involved in different enzymatic reactions, but their enriched terms suggest that they share commonality in their involvement in lipid metabolism, peroxisomal function, and detoxification processes. The pathway could involve the breakdown of lipids by enzymes such as acyl-CoA ligases, which produce acyl-CoA molecules. These molecules can then be transferred to peroxisomes, where they undergo beta-oxidation to produce energy and detoxification. This suggests that these genes might play a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the balance between lipid metabolism and detoxification processes.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.
