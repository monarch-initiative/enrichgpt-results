          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          Provide results in the format

          Summary: <high level summary>
          Mechanism: <mechanism>
          Enriched Terms: <term1>; <term2>; <term3>

          For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number the list.
          Always put the list of terms last, after mechanism, summary, or hypotheses.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          Enriched Terms: testis development; spermatogenesis; sperm motility; acrosome reaction; male gamete generation; testicular germ cell proliferation

          Mechanism and Hypothesis: These genes all have roles in either male reproductive development or sperm function, which suggests they may share a common pathway or mechanism in regulating these processes. One hypothesis is that these genes may be involved in the regulation of gene expression during spermatogenesis, as many of them are specifically expressed in the testes and have been linked to sperm motility and acrosome reaction.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.
