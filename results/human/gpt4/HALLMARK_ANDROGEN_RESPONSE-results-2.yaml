        ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules
        across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven
        distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). This protein
        is a member of the MRP subfamily whic...


        ABHD2: This gene encodes a protein containing an alpha/beta hydrolase fold,
        which is a catalytic domain found in a wide range of enzymes. The encoded
        protein is an acylglycerol lipase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of endocannabinoid
        arachidonoylglycerol from t...


        ACSL3: The protein encoded by this gene is an isozyme of the long-chain fatty-acid-coenzyme
        A ligase family. Although differing in substrate specificity, subcellular
        localization, and tissue distribution, all isozymes of this family convert
        free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters, and thereby play a
        key role in lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid...


        ACTN1: Alpha actinins belong to the spectrin gene superfamily which represents
        a diverse group of cytoskeletal proteins, including the alpha and beta spectrins
        and dystrophins. Alpha actinin is an actin-binding protein with multiple roles
        in different cell types. In nonmuscle cells, the cytoskeletal isoform is found
        along microfilament bundles and adherens-type junctions, where it is involved
        in binding actin to the membrane. In contrast, skel...


        ADAMTS1: This gene encodes a member of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase
        with thrombospondin motif) protein family. Members of the family share several
        distinct protein modules, including a propeptide region, a metalloproteinase
        domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and a thrombospondin type 1 (TS) motif.
        Individual members of this family differ in the number of C-terminal TS motifs,
        and some have unique C-termi...


        ADRM1: This gene encodes a member of the adhesion regulating molecule 1 protein
        family. The encoded protein is a component of the proteasome where it acts
        as a ubiquitin receptor and recruits the deubiquitinating enzyme, ubiquitin
        carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L5. Increased levels of the encoded p...


        AKAP12: The A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs) are a group of structurally diverse
        proteins, which have the common function of binding to the regulatory subunit
        of protein kinase A (PKA) and confining the holoenzyme to discrete locations
        within the cell. This gene encodes a member of the AKAP family. The encoded
        protein is expressed in endothelial cells, cultured fibroblasts, and osteosarcoma
        cells. It associates with protein k...


        AKT1: This gene encodes one of the three members of the human AKT serine-threonine
        protein kinase family which are often referred to as protein kinase B alpha,
        beta, and gamma. These highly similar AKT proteins all have an N-terminal
        pleckstrin homology domain, a serine/threonine-specific kinase domain and
        a C-terminal regulatory domain. These proteins are phosphorylated by phosphoinositide
        3-kinase (PI3K). AKT/PI3K forms a key component of many signalling pathways
        that involve the binding of membrane-bound ligands such as receptor tyrosine
        kinases, G-protein coupled receptors, and integrin-linked kinase. These AKT
        proteins therefore regulate a wide variety of cellular functions including
        cell proliferation, survival, metabolism, and angiogenesis in both normal
        and malignant cells. AKT proteins are recruited to the cell membrane by phosphatidylinositol
        3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) after phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
        (PIP2) by PI3K. Subsequent phosphorylation of both threonine residue 308 and
        serine residue 473 is required for full activation of the AKT1 protein encoded
        by this gene. Phosphorylation of ...


        ALDH1A3: This gene encodes an aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme that uses retinal
        as a substrate. Mutations in this gene have been associated with microphthalmia,

        cells. Progressive ankylosis-mediated control of pyrophosphate levels has
        been suggested as a p...


        APPBP2: The protein encoded by this gene interacts with microtubules and is
        functionally associated with beta-amyloid precursor protein transport and/or
        processing. The beta-amyloid precursor protein is a cell surface protein with
        signal-transducing properties, and it is thought to play a ...


        ARID5B: This gene encodes a member of the AT-rich interaction domain (ARID)
        family of DNA binding proteins. The encoded protein forms a histone H3K9Me2
        demethylase complex with PHD finger protein 2 and regulates the transcription
        of target genes involved in adipogenesis and liver development. This gene
        also plays a rol...

        all nucleated cells. The protein has a predominantly beta-pleated sheet structure
        that can form amyloid...


        B4GALT1: This gene is one of seven beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT)
        genes. They encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have
        exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose; all transfer
        galactose in a beta1,4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars: GlcNAc, Glc, and
        Xyl. Each beta4GalT has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different
        glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they
        have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to
        the Golgi apparatus and which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane
        anchor. By sequence similarity, the beta4GalTs form four groups: beta4GalT1
        and beta4GalT2, beta4GalT3 and beta4GalT4, beta4GalT5 and beta4GalT6, and
        beta4GalT7. This gene is unique among the beta4GalT genes because it encodes
        an enzyme that participates both in glycoconjugate and lactose...


        BMPR1B: This gene encodes a member of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
        receptor family of transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. The ligands of
        this receptor are BMPs, which are members of the TGF-beta superfamily. BMPs
        are involved in endochondral bone formation and embryogenesis. These proteins
        transduce their signals through the formation of heteromeric complexes of
        2 different types of serine (threonine) kinase receptors: type I receptors

        and dystrophins. Alpha actinin is an actin-binding protein with multiple roles
        in different cell types. In nonmuscle cells, the cytoskeletal isoform is found
        along microfilament bundles and adherens-type junctions, where it is involved
        in binding actin to the membrane. In contrast, skel...


        ADAMTS1: This gene encodes a member of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase

        AKT1: This gene encodes one of the three members of the human AKT serine-threonine
        protein kinase family which are often referred to as protein kinase B alpha,
        beta, and gamma. These highly similar AKT proteins all have an N-terminal
        pleckstrin homology domain, a serine/threonine-specific kinase domain and
        a C-terminal regulatory domain. These proteins are phosphorylated by phosphoinositide
        3-kinase (PI3K). AKT/PI3K forms a key component of many signalling pathways
        that involve the binding of membrane-bound ligands such as receptor tyrosine
        kinases, G-protein coupled receptors, and integrin-linked kinase. These AKT
        proteins therefore regulate a wide variety of cellular functions including
        cell proliferation, survival, metabolism, and angiogenesis in both normal
        and malignant cells. AKT proteins are recruited to the cell membrane by phosphatidylinositol
        3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) after phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
        (PIP2) by PI3K. Subsequent phosphorylation of both threonine residue 308 and
        serine residue 473 is required for full activation of the AKT1 protein encoded
        by this gene. Phosphorylation of ...

        B4GALT1: This gene is one of seven beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT)
        genes. They encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have
        exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose; all transfer
        galactose in a beta1,4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars: GlcNAc, Glc, and
        Xyl. Each beta4GalT has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different
        glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they
        have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to
        the Golgi apparatus and which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane
        anchor. By sequence similarity, the beta4GalTs form four groups: beta4GalT1
        and beta4GalT2, beta4GalT3 and beta4GalT4, beta4GalT5 and beta4GalT6, and
        beta4GalT7. This gene is unique among the beta4GalT genes because it encodes

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        B4GALT1: This gene is one of seven beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT)
        genes. They encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have
        exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose; all transfer
        galactose in a beta1,4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars: GlcNAc, Glc, and

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.
