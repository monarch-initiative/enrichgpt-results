          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          Here are the gene summaries:


          FZD6: This gene represents a member of the 'frizzled' gene family, which encode 7-transmembrane domain proteins that are receptors for Wnt signaling proteins. The protein encoded by this family member contains a signal peptide, a cysteine-rich domain in the N-terminal extracellular region, and seven transmembrane domains, but unlike other family members, this protein does not contain a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif. This protein functions as a negative regulator of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling cascade, thereby inhibiting the processes that trigger oncogenic transformation, cell proliferation, and inhibition of apoptosis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, some of which do not encode a protein with a predicted signal peptide.[provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]

          VPS39: This gene encodes a protein that may promote clustering and fusion of late endosomes and lysosomes. The protein may also act as an adaptor protein that modulates the transforming growth factor-beta response by coupling the transforming growth factor-beta receptor complex to the Smad pathway. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2014]

          WDR11: This gene encodes a member of the WD repeat protein family. WD repeats are minimally conserved regions of approximately 40 amino acids typically bracketed by gly-his and trp-asp (GH-WD), which may facilitate formation of heterotrimeric or multiprotein complexes. Members of this family are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, apoptosis, and gene regulation. This gene is located in the chromosome 10q25-26 region, which is frequently deleted in gliomas and tumors of other tissues, and is disrupted by the t(10;19) translocation rearrangement in glioblastoma cells. The gene location suggests that it is a candidate gene for the tumor suppressor locus. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.
