        APOH: Apolipoprotein H, also known as beta-2-glycoprotein I, is a component
        of circulating plasma lipoproteins. It has been implicated in a variety of
        physiologic pathways including lipoprotein metabolism, coagulation, hemostasis,
        and the production of antiphospholipid autoantibodies. APOH may be a required
        cofactor for anionic phospholipid binding by the antiphospholipid autoantibodies
        found in sera of many patients with lupus and primary antiphospholipid syndrome
        (APS). The anti-beta (2) glycoprotein I antibodies from APS patients, mediate
        inhibition of activated protein C which has anticoagulant properties. Because
        beta-2-GPI is the main autoantigen in patients with APS, the disruption of
        this pathway by autoantibodies may be an important mechanism for thrombosis
        in patients with APS.[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2019]


        APP: This gene encodes a cell surface receptor and transmembrane precursor
        protein that is cleaved by secretases to form a number of peptides. Some of
        these peptides are secreted and can bind to the acetyltransferase complex
        APBB1/TIP60 to promote transcriptional activation, while others form the protein
        basis of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer
        disease. In addition, two of the peptides are antimicrobial peptides, having
        been shown to have bacteriocidal and antifungal activities. Mutations in this
        gene have been implicated in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease and cerebroarterial
        amyloidosis (cerebral amyloid angiopathy). Multiple transcript variants encoding
        several different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq,

        CCND2: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin
        family, whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein
        abundance through the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK kinases.
        Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns which
        contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This cyclin
        forms a complex with CDK4 or CDK6 and functions as a regulatory subunit of
        the complex, whose activity is required for cell cycle G1/S transition. This
        protein has been shown to interact with and be involved in the phosphorylation
        of tumor suppressor protein Rb. Knockout studies of the homologous gene in
        mouse suggest the essential roles of this gene in ovarian granulosa and germ
        cell proliferation. High level expression of this gene was observed in ovarian
        and testicular tumors. Mutations in this gene are associated with megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus
        syndrome 3 (MPPH3). [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2014]


        COL3A1: This gene encodes the pro-alpha1 chains of type III collagen, a fibrillar
        collagen that is found in extensible connective tissues such as skin, lung,
        uterus, intestine and the vascular system, frequently in association with
        type I collagen. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos
        syndrome type IV, and with aortic and arterial aneurysms. [provided by R.
        Dalgleish, Feb 2008]


        COL5A2: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar
        collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of
        one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing
        type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers
        composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely
        related to type XI collagen and it is possible that the collagen chains of
        types V and XI constitute a single collagen type with tissue-specific chain
        combinations. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
        types I and II. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        CXCL6: The protein encoded by this gene is a member CXC chemokine family.
        The encoded protein is a chemotactic for neutrophil granulocytes and has antibacterial
        action against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. This gene and other
        members of the CXC chemokine gene family form a gene cluster in a region of
        chromosome 4q. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2020]


        FGFR1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth
        factor receptor (FGFR) family, where amino acid sequence is highly conserved
        between members and throughout evolution. FGFR family members differ from
        one another in their ligand affinities and tissue distribution. A full-length
        representative protein consists of an extracellular region, composed of three
        immunoglobulin-like domains, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment
        and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular portion of the
        protein interacts with fibroblast growth factors, setting in motion a cascade
        of downstream signals, ultimately influencing mitogenesis and differentiation.
        This particular family member binds both acidic and basic fibroblast growth
        factors and is involved in limb induction. Mutations in this gene have been
        associated with Pfeiffer syndrome, Jackson-Weiss syndrome, Antley-Bixler syndrome,
        osteoglophonic dysplasia, and autosomal dominant Kallmann syndrome 2. Chromosomal
        aberrations involving this gene are associated with stem cell myeloproliferative
        disorder and stem cell leukemia lymphoma syndrome. Alternatively spliced variants
        which encode different protein isoforms have been described; however, not
        all variants have been fully characterized. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FSTL1: This gene encodes a protein with similarity to follistatin, an activin-binding
        protein. It contains an FS module, a follistatin-like sequence containing
        10 conserved cysteine residues. This gene product is thought to be an autoantigen
        associated with rheumatoid arthritis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ITGAV: The product of this gene belongs to the integrin alpha chain family.
        Integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha
        subunit and a beta subunit that function in cell surface adhesion and signaling.
        The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate light and
        heavy chains that comprise the alpha V subunit. This subunit associates with
        beta 1, beta 3, beta 5, beta 6 and beta 8 subunits. The heterodimer consisting
        of alpha V and beta 3 subunits is also known as the vitronectin receptor.
        This integrin may regulate angiogenesis and cancer progression. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Note that the integrin alpha
        5 and integrin alpha V subunits are encoded by distinct genes. [provided by
        RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        JAG1: The jagged 1 protein encoded by JAG1 is the human homolog of the Drosophilia
        jagged protein. Human jagged 1 is the ligand for the receptor notch 1, the
        latter is involved in signaling processes. Mutations that alter the jagged
        1 protein cause Alagille syndrome. Jagged 1 signalling through notch 1 has
        also been shown to play a role in hematopoiesis. [provided by RefSeq, Nov
        2019]


        JAG2: The Notch signaling pathway is an intercellular signaling mechanism
        that is essential for proper embryonic development. Members of the Notch gene
        family encode transmembrane receptors that are critical for various cell fate
        decisions. The protein encoded by this gene is one of several ligands that
        activate Notch and related receptors. Two transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        KCNJ8: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they
        participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded
        by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium
        channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium
        to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins.
        Defects in this gene may be a cause of J-wave syndromes and sudden infant
        death syndrome (SIDS). [provided by RefSeq, May 2012]


        LPL: LPL encodes lipoprotein lipase, which is expressed in heart, muscle,
        and adipose tissue. LPL functions as a homodimer, and has the dual functions
        of triglyceride hydrolase and ligand/bridging factor for receptor-mediated
        lipoprotein uptake. Severe mutations that cause LPL deficiency result in type
        I hyperlipoproteinemia, while less extreme mutations in LPL are linked to
        many disorders of lipoprotein metabolism. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        LRPAP1: This gene encodes a protein that interacts with the low density lipoprotein
        (LDL) receptor-related protein and facilitates its proper folding and localization
        by preventing the binding of ligands. Mutations in this gene have been identified
        in individuals with myopia 23. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2013]


        LUM: This gene encodes a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP)
        family that includes decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, keratocan, epiphycan,
        and osteoglycin. In these bifunctional molecules, the protein moiety binds
        collagen fibrils and the highly charged hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans regulate
        interfibrillar spacings. Lumican is the major keratan sulfate proteoglycan
        of the cornea but is also distributed in interstitial collagenous matrices
        throughout the body. Lumican may regulate collagen fibril organization and
        circumferential growth, corneal transparency, and epithelial cell migration
        and tissue repair. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        MSX1: This gene encodes a member of the muscle segment homeobox gene family.
        The encoded protein functions as a transcriptional repressor during embryogenesis
        through interactions with components of the core transcription complex and
        other homeoproteins. It may also have roles in limb-pattern formation, craniofacial
        development, particularly odontogenesis, and tumor growth inhibition. Mutations
        in this gene, which was once known as homeobox 7, have been associated with
        nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate 5, Witkop syndrome, Wolf-Hirschom
        syndrome, and autosomoal dominant hypodontia. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        NRP1: This gene encodes one of two neuropilins, which contain specific protein
        domains which allow them to participate in several different types of signaling
        pathways that control cell migration. Neuropilins contain a large N-terminal
        extracellular domain, made up of complement-binding, coagulation factor V/VIII,
        and meprin domains. These proteins also contains a short membrane-spanning
        domain and a small cytoplasmic domain. Neuropilins bind many ligands and various
        types of co-receptors; they affect cell survival, migration, and attraction.
        Some of the ligands and co-receptors bound by neuropilins are vascular endothelial
        growth factor (VEGF) and semaphorin family members. This protein has also
        been determined to act as a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19)
        to infect host cells. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2020]


        OLR1: This gene encodes a low density lipoprotein receptor that belongs to
        the C-type lectin superfamily. This gene is regulated through the cyclic AMP
        signaling pathway. The encoded protein binds, internalizes and degrades oxidized
        low-density lipoprotein. This protein may be involved in the regulation of
        Fas-induced apoptosis. This protein may play a role as a scavenger receptor.
        Mutations of this gene have been associated with atherosclerosis, risk of
        myocardial infarction, and may modify the risk of Alzheimer''s disease. Alternate
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Feb
        2010]


        PDGFA: This gene encodes a member of the protein family comprised of both
        platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factors
        (VEGF). The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate
        platelet-derived growth factor subunit A, which can homodimerize, or alternatively,
        heterodimerize with the related platelet-derived growth factor subunit B.
        These proteins bind and activate PDGF receptor tyrosine kinases, which play
        a role in a wide range of developmental processes. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        PF4: This gene encodes a member of the CXC chemokine family. This chemokine
        is released from the alpha granules of activated platelets in the form of
        a homotetramer which has high affinity for heparin and is involved in platelet
        aggregation. This protein is chemotactic for numerous other cell type and
        also functions as an inhibitor of hematopoiesis, angiogenesis and T-cell function.
        The protein also exhibits antimicrobial activity against Plasmodium falciparum.

        PGLYRP1: Enables peptidoglycan binding activity and peptidoglycan immune receptor
        activity. Involved in antimicrobial humoral immune response mediated by antimicrobial
        peptide; killing of cells of other organism; and response to bacterium. Located
        in extracellular exosome. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        POSTN: This gene encodes a secreted extracellular matrix protein that functions
        in tissue development and regeneration, including wound healing, and ventricular
        remodeling following myocardial infarction. The encoded protein binds to integrins
        to support adhesion and migration of epithelial cells. This protein plays
        a role in cancer stem cell maintenance and metastasis. Mice lacking this gene
        exhibit cardiac valve disease, and skeletal and dental defects. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.
        [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]


        PRG2: The protein encoded by this gene is the predominant constituent of the
        crystalline core of the eosinophil granule. High levels of the proform of
        this protein are also present in placenta and pregnancy serum, where it exists
        as a complex with several other proteins including pregnancy-associated plasma
        protein A (PAPPA), angiotensinogen (AGT), and C3dg. This protein may be involved
        in antiparasitic defense mechanisms as a cytotoxin and helminthotoxin, and
        in immune hypersensitivity reactions. The encoded protein contains a peptide
        that displays potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria,
        Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. It is directly implicated in epithelial
        cell damage, exfoliation, and bronchospasm in allergic diseases. Alternatively
        spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for
        this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]


        PTK2: This gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase which is found
        concentrated in the focal adhesions that form between cells growing in the
        presence of extracellular matrix constituents. The encoded protein is a member
        of the FAK subfamily of protein tyrosine kinases but lacks significant sequence
        similarity to kinases from other subfamilies. Activation of this gene may
        be an important early step in cell growth and intracellular signal transduction
        pathways triggered in response to certain neural peptides or to cell interactions
        with the extracellular matrix. Several transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2017]


        S100A4: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the S100 family of
        proteins containing 2 EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. S100 proteins are localized
        in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, and involved in
        the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression
        and differentiation. S100 genes include at least 13 members which are located
        as a cluster on chromosome 1q21. This protein may function in motility, invasion,
        and tubulin polymerization. Chromosomal rearrangements and altered expression
        of this gene have been implicated in tumor metastasis. Multiple alternatively
        spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        SERPINA5: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the serpin family
        of proteins, a group of proteins that inhibit serine proteases. This gene
        is one in a cluster of serpin genes located on the q arm of chromosome 14.
        This family member is a glycoprotein that can inhibit several serine proteases,
        including protein C and various plasminogen activators and kallikreins, and
        it thus plays diverse roles in hemostasis and thrombosis in multiple organs.
        [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2012]


        SLCO2A1: This gene encodes a prostaglandin transporter that is a member of
        the 12-membrane-spanning superfamily of transporters. The encoded protein
        may be involved in mediating the uptake and clearance of prostaglandins in
        numerous tissues. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]


        SPP1: The protein encoded by this gene is involved in the attachment of osteoclasts
        to the mineralized bone matrix. The encoded protein is secreted and binds
        hydroxyapatite with high affinity. The osteoclast vitronectin receptor is
        found in the cell membrane and may be involved in the binding to this protein.
        This protein is also a cytokine that upregulates expression of interferon-gamma
        and interleukin-12. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms
        have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2011]


        STC1: This gene encodes a secreted, homodimeric glycoprotein that is expressed
        in a wide variety of tissues and may have autocrine or paracrine functions.
        The gene contains a 5'' UTR rich in CAG trinucleotide repeats. The encoded
        protein contains 11 conserved cysteine residues and is phosphorylated by protein
        kinase C exclusively on its serine residues. The protein may play a role in
        the regulation of renal and intestinal calcium and phosphate transport, cell
        metabolism, or cellular calcium/phosphate homeostasis. Overexpression of human
        stanniocalcin 1 in mice produces high serum phosphate levels, dwarfism, and
        increased metabolic rate. This gene has altered expression in hepatocellular,
        ovarian, and breast cancers. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        THBD: The protein encoded by this intronless gene is an endothelial-specific
        type I membrane receptor that binds thrombin. This binding results in the
        activation of protein C, which degrades clotting factors Va and VIIIa and
        reduces the amount of thrombin generated. Mutations in this gene are a cause
        of thromboembolic disease, also known as inherited thrombophilia. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        TIMP1: This gene belongs to the TIMP gene family. The proteins encoded by
        this gene family are natural inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
        a group of peptidases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        In addition to its inhibitory role against most of the known MMPs, the encoded
        protein is able to promote cell proliferation in a wide range of cell types,
        and may also have an anti-apoptotic function. Transcription of this gene is
        highly inducible in response to many cytokines and hormones. In addition,
        the expression from some but not all inactive X chromosomes suggests that
        this gene inactivation is polymorphic in human females. This gene is located
        within intron 6 of the synapsin I gene and is transcribed in the opposite
        direction. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        TNFRSF21: This gene encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor
        superfamily. The encoded protein activates nuclear factor kappa-B and mitogen-activated
        protein kinase 8 (also called c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1), and induces cell
        apoptosis. Through its death domain, the encoded receptor interacts with tumor
        necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated death domain (TRADD) protein, which
        is known to mediate signal transduction of tumor necrosis factor receptors.
        Knockout studies in mice suggest that this gene plays a role in T-helper cell
        activation, and may be involved in inflammation and immune regulation. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2013]


        VAV2: VAV2 is the second member of the VAV guanine nucleotide exchange factor
        family of oncogenes. Unlike VAV1, which is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic
        cells, VAV2 transcripts were found in most tissues. Alternatively spliced
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
        [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2008]


        VCAN: This gene is a member of the aggrecan/versican proteoglycan family.
        The protein encoded is a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan and is a major
        component of the extracellular matrix. This protein is involved in cell adhesion,
        proliferation, proliferation, migration and angiogenesis and plays a central
        role in tissue morphogenesis and maintenance. Mutations in this gene are the
        cause of Wagner syndrome type 1. Multiple transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2009]


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expression of some isoforms derived from the AUG start
        codon is regulated by a small upstream open reading frame, which is located
        within an internal ribosome entry site. The levels of VEGF are increased during
        infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
        thus promoting inflammation by facilitating recruitment of inflammatory cells,
        and by increasing the level of angiopoietin II (Ang II), one of two products
        of the SARS-CoV-2 binding target, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
        In turn, Ang II facilitates the elevation of VEGF, thus forming a vicious
        cycle in the release of inflammatory cytokines. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2020]


        VTN: The protein encoded by this gene functions in part as an adhesive glycoprotein.
        Differential expression of this protein can promote either cell adhesion or
        migration as it links cells to the extracellular matrix through a variety
        of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1,
        and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be
        present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular
        matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging
        effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpin
        serine protease inhibitors. This protein can also promote extracellular matrix
        degradation and thus plays a role in tumorigenesis. It is involved in a variety
        of other biological processes such as the regulation of the coagulation pathway,
        wound healing, and tissue remodeling. The heparin-binding domain of this protein
        give it anti-microbial properties. It is also a lipid binding protein that
        forms a principal component of high density lipoprotein. [provided by RefSeq,

        APOH: Apolipoprotein H, also known as beta-2-glycoprotein I, is a component
        of circulating plasma lipoproteins. It has been implicated in a variety of
        physiologic pathways including lipoprotein metabolism, coagulation, hemostasis,
        and the production of antiphospholipid autoantibodies. APOH may be a required
        cofactor for anionic phospholipid binding by the antiphospholipid autoantibodies
        found in sera of many patients with lupus and primary antiphospholipid syndrome
        (APS). The anti-beta (2) glycoprotein I antibodies from APS patients, mediate
        inhibition of activated protein C which has anticoagulant properties. Because
        beta-2-GPI is the main autoantigen in patients with APS, the disruption of
        this pathway by autoantibodies may be an important mechanism for thrombosis
        in patients with APS.[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2019]


        APP: This gene encodes a cell surface receptor and transmembrane precursor
        protein that is cleaved by secretases to form a number of peptides. Some of
        these peptides are secreted and can bind to the acetyltransferase complex
        APBB1/TIP60 to promote transcriptional activation, while others form the protein
        basis of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer
        disease. In addition, two of the peptides are antimicrobial peptides, having
        been shown to have bacteriocidal and antifungal activities. Mutations in this
        gene have been implicated in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease and cerebroarterial
        amyloidosis (cerebral amyloid angiopathy). Multiple transcript variants encoding
        several different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq,

        CCND2: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin
        family, whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein
        abundance through the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK kinases.
        Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns which
        contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This cyclin
        forms a complex with CDK4 or CDK6 and functions as a regulatory subunit of
        the complex, whose activity is required for cell cycle G1/S transition. This
        protein has been shown to interact with and be involved in the phosphorylation
        of tumor suppressor protein Rb. Knockout studies of the homologous gene in
        mouse suggest the essential roles of this gene in ovarian granulosa and germ
        cell proliferation. High level expression of this gene was observed in ovarian
        and testicular tumors. Mutations in this gene are associated with megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus
        syndrome 3 (MPPH3). [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2014]


        COL3A1: This gene encodes the pro-alpha1 chains of type III collagen, a fibrillar
        collagen that is found in extensible connective tissues such as skin, lung,
        uterus, intestine and the vascular system, frequently in association with
        type I collagen. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos
        syndrome type IV, and with aortic and arterial aneurysms. [provided by R.
        Dalgleish, Feb 2008]


        COL5A2: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar
        collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of
        one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing
        type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers
        composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely
        related to type XI collagen and it is possible that the collagen chains of
        types V and XI constitute a single collagen type with tissue-specific chain
        combinations. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
        types I and II. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        CXCL6: The protein encoded by this gene is a member CXC chemokine family.
        The encoded protein is a chemotactic for neutrophil granulocytes and has antibacterial
        action against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. This gene and other
        members of the CXC chemokine gene family form a gene cluster in a region of
        chromosome 4q. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2020]


        FGFR1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth
        factor receptor (FGFR) family, where amino acid sequence is highly conserved
        between members and throughout evolution. FGFR family members differ from
        one another in their ligand affinities and tissue distribution. A full-length
        representative protein consists of an extracellular region, composed of three
        immunoglobulin-like domains, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment
        and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular portion of the
        protein interacts with fibroblast growth factors, setting in motion a cascade
        of downstream signals, ultimately influencing mitogenesis and differentiation.
        This particular family member binds both acidic and basic fibroblast growth
        factors and is involved in limb induction. Mutations in this gene have been
        associated with Pfeiffer syndrome, Jackson-Weiss syndrome, Antley-Bixler syndrome,
        osteoglophonic dysplasia, and autosomal dominant Kallmann syndrome 2. Chromosomal
        aberrations involving this gene are associated with stem cell myeloproliferative
        disorder and stem cell leukemia lymphoma syndrome. Alternatively spliced variants
        which encode different protein isoforms have been described; however, not
        all variants have been fully characterized. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FSTL1: This gene encodes a protein with similarity to follistatin, an activin-binding
        protein. It contains an FS module, a follistatin-like sequence containing
        10 conserved cysteine residues. This gene product is thought to be an autoantigen
        associated with rheumatoid arthritis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ITGAV: The product of this gene belongs to the integrin alpha chain family.
        Integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha
        subunit and a beta subunit that function in cell surface adhesion and signaling.
        The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate light and
        heavy chains that comprise the alpha V subunit. This subunit associates with
        beta 1, beta 3, beta 5, beta 6 and beta 8 subunits. The heterodimer consisting
        of alpha V and beta 3 subunits is also known as the vitronectin receptor.
        This integrin may regulate angiogenesis and cancer progression. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Note that the integrin alpha
        5 and integrin alpha V subunits are encoded by distinct genes. [provided by
        RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        JAG1: The jagged 1 protein encoded by JAG1 is the human homolog of the Drosophilia
        jagged protein. Human jagged 1 is the ligand for the receptor notch 1, the
        latter is involved in signaling processes. Mutations that alter the jagged
        1 protein cause Alagille syndrome. Jagged 1 signalling through notch 1 has
        also been shown to play a role in hematopoiesis. [provided by RefSeq, Nov
        2019]


        JAG2: The Notch signaling pathway is an intercellular signaling mechanism
        that is essential for proper embryonic development. Members of the Notch gene
        family encode transmembrane receptors that are critical for various cell fate
        decisions. The protein encoded by this gene is one of several ligands that
        activate Notch and related receptors. Two transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        KCNJ8: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they
        participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded
        by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium
        channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium
        to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins.
        Defects in this gene may be a cause of J-wave syndromes and sudden infant
        death syndrome (SIDS). [provided by RefSeq, May 2012]


        LPL: LPL encodes lipoprotein lipase, which is expressed in heart, muscle,
        and adipose tissue. LPL functions as a homodimer, and has the dual functions
        of triglyceride hydrolase and ligand/bridging factor for receptor-mediated
        lipoprotein uptake. Severe mutations that cause LPL deficiency result in type
        I hyperlipoproteinemia, while less extreme mutations in LPL are linked to
        many disorders of lipoprotein metabolism. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        LRPAP1: This gene encodes a protein that interacts with the low density lipoprotein
        (LDL) receptor-related protein and facilitates its proper folding and localization
        by preventing the binding of ligands. Mutations in this gene have been identified
        in individuals with myopia 23. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2013]


        LUM: This gene encodes a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP)
        family that includes decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, keratocan, epiphycan,
        and osteoglycin. In these bifunctional molecules, the protein moiety binds
        collagen fibrils and the highly charged hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans regulate
        interfibrillar spacings. Lumican is the major keratan sulfate proteoglycan
        of the cornea but is also distributed in interstitial collagenous matrices
        throughout the body. Lumican may regulate collagen fibril organization and
        circumferential growth, corneal transparency, and epithelial cell migration
        and tissue repair. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        MSX1: This gene encodes a member of the muscle segment homeobox gene family.
        The encoded protein functions as a transcriptional repressor during embryogenesis
        through interactions with components of the core transcription complex and
        other homeoproteins. It may also have roles in limb-pattern formation, craniofacial
        development, particularly odontogenesis, and tumor growth inhibition. Mutations
        in this gene, which was once known as homeobox 7, have been associated with
        nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate 5, Witkop syndrome, Wolf-Hirschom
        syndrome, and autosomoal dominant hypodontia. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        NRP1: This gene encodes one of two neuropilins, which contain specific protein
        domains which allow them to participate in several different types of signaling
        pathways that control cell migration. Neuropilins contain a large N-terminal
        extracellular domain, made up of complement-binding, coagulation factor V/VIII,
        and meprin domains. These proteins also contains a short membrane-spanning
        domain and a small cytoplasmic domain. Neuropilins bind many ligands and various
        types of co-receptors; they affect cell survival, migration, and attraction.
        Some of the ligands and co-receptors bound by neuropilins are vascular endothelial
        growth factor (VEGF) and semaphorin family members. This protein has also
        been determined to act as a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19)
        to infect host cells. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2020]


        OLR1: This gene encodes a low density lipoprotein receptor that belongs to
        the C-type lectin superfamily. This gene is regulated through the cyclic AMP
        signaling pathway. The encoded protein binds, internalizes and degrades oxidized
        low-density lipoprotein. This protein may be involved in the regulation of
        Fas-induced apoptosis. This protein may play a role as a scavenger receptor.
        Mutations of this gene have been associated with atherosclerosis, risk of
        myocardial infarction, and may modify the risk of Alzheimer''s disease. Alternate
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Feb
        2010]


        PDGFA: This gene encodes a member of the protein family comprised of both
        platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factors
        (VEGF). The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate
        platelet-derived growth factor subunit A, which can homodimerize, or alternatively,
        heterodimerize with the related platelet-derived growth factor subunit B.
        These proteins bind and activate PDGF receptor tyrosine kinases, which play
        a role in a wide range of developmental processes. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        PF4: This gene encodes a member of the CXC chemokine family. This chemokine
        is released from the alpha granules of activated platelets in the form of
        a homotetramer which has high affinity for heparin and is involved in platelet
        aggregation. This protein is chemotactic for numerous other cell type and
        also functions as an inhibitor of hematopoiesis, angiogenesis and T-cell function.
        The protein also exhibits antimicrobial activity against Plasmodium falciparum.

        PGLYRP1: Enables peptidoglycan binding activity and peptidoglycan immune receptor
        activity. Involved in antimicrobial humoral immune response mediated by antimicrobial
        peptide; killing of cells of other organism; and response to bacterium. Located
        in extracellular exosome. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        POSTN: This gene encodes a secreted extracellular matrix protein that functions
        in tissue development and regeneration, including wound healing, and ventricular
        remodeling following myocardial infarction. The encoded protein binds to integrins
        to support adhesion and migration of epithelial cells. This protein plays
        a role in cancer stem cell maintenance and metastasis. Mice lacking this gene
        exhibit cardiac valve disease, and skeletal and dental defects. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.

        PRG2: The protein encoded by this gene is the predominant constituent of the
        crystalline core of the eosinophil granule. High levels of the proform of
        this protein are also present in placenta and pregnancy serum, where it exists
        as a complex with several other proteins including pregnancy-associated plasma
        protein A (PAPPA), angiotensinogen (AGT), and C3dg. This protein may be involved
        in antiparasitic defense mechanisms as a cytotoxin and helminthotoxin, and
        in immune hypersensitivity reactions. The encoded protein contains a peptide
        that displays potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria,
        Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. It is directly implicated in epithelial
        cell damage, exfoliation, and bronchospasm in allergic diseases. Alternatively
        spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for
        this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]


        PTK2: This gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase which is found
        concentrated in the focal adhesions that form between cells growing in the
        presence of extracellular matrix constituents. The encoded protein is a member
        of the FAK subfamily of protein tyrosine kinases but lacks significant sequence
        similarity to kinases from other subfamilies. Activation of this gene may
        be an important early step in cell growth and intracellular signal transduction
        pathways triggered in response to certain neural peptides or to cell interactions
        with the extracellular matrix. Several transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2017]


        S100A4: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the S100 family of
        proteins containing 2 EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. S100 proteins are localized
        in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, and involved in
        the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression
        and differentiation. S100 genes include at least 13 members which are located
        as a cluster on chromosome 1q21. This protein may function in motility, invasion,
        and tubulin polymerization. Chromosomal rearrangements and altered expression
        of this gene have been implicated in tumor metastasis. Multiple alternatively
        spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        SERPINA5: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the serpin family
        of proteins, a group of proteins that inhibit serine proteases. This gene
        is one in a cluster of serpin genes located on the q arm of chromosome 14.
        This family member is a glycoprotein that can inhibit several serine proteases,
        including protein C and various plasminogen activators and kallikreins, and
        it thus plays diverse roles in hemostasis and thrombosis in multiple organs.
        [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2012]


        SLCO2A1: This gene encodes a prostaglandin transporter that is a member of
        the 12-membrane-spanning superfamily of transporters. The encoded protein
        may be involved in mediating the uptake and clearance of prostaglandins in
        numerous tissues. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]


        SPP1: The protein encoded by this gene is involved in the attachment of osteoclasts
        to the mineralized bone matrix. The encoded protein is secreted and binds
        hydroxyapatite with high affinity. The osteoclast vitronectin receptor is
        found in the cell membrane and may be involved in the binding to this protein.
        This protein is also a cytokine that upregulates expression of interferon-gamma
        and interleukin-12. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms
        have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2011]


        STC1: This gene encodes a secreted, homodimeric glycoprotein that is expressed
        in a wide variety of tissues and may have autocrine or paracrine functions.
        The gene contains a 5'' UTR rich in CAG trinucleotide repeats. The encoded
        protein contains 11 conserved cysteine residues and is phosphorylated by protein
        kinase C exclusively on its serine residues. The protein may play a role in
        the regulation of renal and intestinal calcium and phosphate transport, cell
        metabolism, or cellular calcium/phosphate homeostasis. Overexpression of human
        stanniocalcin 1 in mice produces high serum phosphate levels, dwarfism, and
        increased metabolic rate. This gene has altered expression in hepatocellular,
        ovarian, and breast cancers. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        THBD: The protein encoded by this intronless gene is an endothelial-specific
        type I membrane receptor that binds thrombin. This binding results in the
        activation of protein C, which degrades clotting factors Va and VIIIa and
        reduces the amount of thrombin generated. Mutations in this gene are a cause
        of thromboembolic disease, also known as inherited thrombophilia. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        TIMP1: This gene belongs to the TIMP gene family. The proteins encoded by
        this gene family are natural inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
        a group of peptidases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        In addition to its inhibitory role against most of the known MMPs, the encoded
        protein is able to promote cell proliferation in a wide range of cell types,
        and may also have an anti-apoptotic function. Transcription of this gene is
        highly inducible in response to many cytokines and hormones. In addition,
        the expression from some but not all inactive X chromosomes suggests that
        this gene inactivation is polymorphic in human females. This gene is located
        within intron 6 of the synapsin I gene and is transcribed in the opposite
        direction. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        TNFRSF21: This gene encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor
        superfamily. The encoded protein activates nuclear factor kappa-B and mitogen-activated
        protein kinase 8 (also called c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1), and induces cell
        apoptosis. Through its death domain, the encoded receptor interacts with tumor
        necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated death domain (TRADD) protein, which
        is known to mediate signal transduction of tumor necrosis factor receptors.
        Knockout studies in mice suggest that this gene plays a role in T-helper cell
        activation, and may be involved in inflammation and immune regulation. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2013]


        VAV2: VAV2 is the second member of the VAV guanine nucleotide exchange factor
        family of oncogenes. Unlike VAV1, which is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic
        cells, VAV2 transcripts were found in most tissues. Alternatively spliced
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
        [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2008]


        VCAN: This gene is a member of the aggrecan/versican proteoglycan family.
        The protein encoded is a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan and is a major
        component of the extracellular matrix. This protein is involved in cell adhesion,
        proliferation, proliferation, migration and angiogenesis and plays a central
        role in tissue morphogenesis and maintenance. Mutations in this gene are the
        cause of Wagner syndrome type 1. Multiple transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2009]


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expression of some isoforms derived from the AUG start
        codon is regulated by a small upstream open reading frame, which is located
        within an internal ribosome entry site. The levels of VEGF are increased during
        infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
        thus promoting inflammation by facilitating recruitment of inflammatory cells,
        and by increasing the level of angiopoietin II (Ang II), one of two products
        of the SARS-CoV-2 binding target, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
        In turn, Ang II facilitates the elevation of VEGF, thus forming a vicious
        cycle in the release of inflammatory cytokines. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2020]


        VTN: The protein encoded by this gene functions in part as an adhesive glycoprotein.
        Differential expression of this protein can promote either cell adhesion or
        migration as it links cells to the extracellular matrix through a variety
        of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1,
        and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be
        present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular
        matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging
        effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpin
        serine protease inhibitors. This protein can also promote extracellular matrix
        degradation and thus plays a role in tumorigenesis. It is involved in a variety
        of other biological processes such as the regulation of the coagulation pathway,
        wound healing, and tissue remodeling. The heparin-binding domain of this protein
        give it anti-microbial properties. It is also a lipid binding protein that
        forms a principal component of high density lipoprotein. [provided by RefSeq,

        role in tissue morphogenesis and ma...


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expr...


        VTN: The protein encoded by this gene functions in part as an adhesive glycoprotein.
        Differential expression of this protein can promote either cell adhesion or
        migration as it links cells to the extracellular matrix through a variety
        of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1,
        and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be
        present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular
        matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging
        effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpin
        serine protease inhibitors. This protein can also promote extracellular matrix
        degr...

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        role in tissue morphogenesis and ma...


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expr...

        Here are the gene summaries:



        PGLYRP1: Enables peptidoglycan binding activity and peptidoglycan immune receptor
        activity. Involved in antimicrobial humoral immune response mediated by antimicrobial
        peptide; killing of cells of other organism; and response to bacterium. Located
        in extracellular exosome. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        CCND2: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin
        family, whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein
        abundance through the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK kinases.
        Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns which
        contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This cyclin
        forms a complex with CDK4 or CDK6 and functions as a regulatory subunit of
        the complex, whose activity is required for cell cycle G1/S transition. This
        protein has been shown to interact with and be involved in the phosphorylation
        of tumor suppressor protein Rb. Knockout studies of the homologous gene in
        mouse suggest the essential roles of this gene in ovarian granulosa and germ
        cell proliferation. High level expression of this gene was observed in ovarian
        and testicular tumors. Mutations in this gene are associated with megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus
        syndrome 3 (MPPH3). [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2014]


        COL5A2: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar
        collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of
        one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing
        type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers
        composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely
        related to type XI collagen and it is possible that the collagen chains of
        types V and XI constitute a single collagen type with tissue-specific chain
        combinations. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
        types I and II. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FSTL1: This gene encodes a protein with similarity to follistatin, an activin-binding
        protein. It contains an FS module, a follistatin-like sequence containing
        10 conserved cysteine residues. This gene product is thought to be an autoantigen
        associated with rheumatoid arthritis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        APP: This gene encodes a cell surface receptor and transmembrane precursor
        protein that is cleaved by secretases to form a number of peptides. Some of
        these peptides are secreted and can bind to the acetyltransferase complex
        APBB1/TIP60 to promote transcriptional activation, while others form the protein
        basis of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer
        disease. In addition, two of the peptides are antimicrobial peptides, having
        been shown to have bacteriocidal and antifungal activities. Mutations in this
        gene have been implicated in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease and cerebroarterial
        amyloidosis (cerebral amyloid angiopathy). Multiple transcript variants encoding
        several different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq,
        Aug 2014]


        LRPAP1: This gene encodes a protein that interacts with the low density lipoprotein
        (LDL) receptor-related protein and facilitates its proper folding and localization
        by preventing the binding of ligands. Mutations in this gene have been identified
        in individuals with myopia 23. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2013]


        SERPINA5: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the serpin family
        of proteins, a group of proteins that inhibit serine proteases. This gene
        is one in a cluster of serpin genes located on the q arm of chromosome 14.
        This family member is a glycoprotein that can inhibit several serine proteases,
        including protein C and various plasminogen activators and kallikreins, and
        it thus plays diverse roles in hemostasis and thrombosis in multiple organs.
        [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2012]


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expression of some isoforms derived from the AUG start
        codon is regulated by a small upstream open reading frame, which is located
        within an internal ribosome entry site. The levels of VEGF are increased during
        infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
        thus promoting inflammation by facilitating recruitment of inflammatory cells,
        and by increasing the level of angiopoietin II (Ang II), one of two products
        of the SARS-CoV-2 binding target, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
        In turn, Ang II facilitates the elevation of VEGF, thus forming a vicious
        cycle in the release of inflammatory cytokines. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2020]


        VCAN: This gene is a member of the aggrecan/versican proteoglycan family.
        The protein encoded is a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan and is a major
        component of the extracellular matrix. This protein is involved in cell adhesion,
        proliferation, proliferation, migration and angiogenesis and plays a central
        role in tissue morphogenesis and maintenance. Mutations in this gene are the
        cause of Wagner syndrome type 1. Multiple transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2009]


        PTK2: This gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase which is found
        concentrated in the focal adhesions that form between cells growing in the
        presence of extracellular matrix constituents. The encoded protein is a member
        of the FAK subfamily of protein tyrosine kinases but lacks significant sequence
        similarity to kinases from other subfamilies. Activation of this gene may
        be an important early step in cell growth and intracellular signal transduction
        pathways triggered in response to certain neural peptides or to cell interactions
        with the extracellular matrix. Several transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2017]


        PDGFA: This gene encodes a member of the protein family comprised of both
        platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factors
        (VEGF). The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate
        platelet-derived growth factor subunit A, which can homodimerize, or alternatively,
        heterodimerize with the related platelet-derived growth factor subunit B.
        These proteins bind and activate PDGF receptor tyrosine kinases, which play
        a role in a wide range of developmental processes. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        COL3A1: This gene encodes the pro-alpha1 chains of type III collagen, a fibrillar
        collagen that is found in extensible connective tissues such as skin, lung,
        uterus, intestine and the vascular system, frequently in association with
        type I collagen. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos
        syndrome type IV, and with aortic and arterial aneurysms. [provided by R.
        Dalgleish, Feb 2008]


        KCNJ8: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they
        participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded
        by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium
        channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium
        to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins.
        Defects in this gene may be a cause of J-wave syndromes and sudden infant
        death syndrome (SIDS). [provided by RefSeq, May 2012]


        PF4: This gene encodes a member of the CXC chemokine family. This chemokine
        is released from the alpha granules of activated platelets in the form of
        a homotetramer which has high affinity for heparin and is involved in platelet
        aggregation. This protein is chemotactic for numerous other cell type and
        also functions as an inhibitor of hematopoiesis, angiogenesis and T-cell function.
        The protein also exhibits antimicrobial activity against Plasmodium falciparum.
        [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2014]


        NRP1: This gene encodes one of two neuropilins, which contain specific protein
        domains which allow them to participate in several different types of signaling
        pathways that control cell migration. Neuropilins contain a large N-terminal
        extracellular domain, made up of complement-binding, coagulation factor V/VIII,
        and meprin domains. These proteins also contains a short membrane-spanning
        domain and a small cytoplasmic domain. Neuropilins bind many ligands and various
        types of co-receptors; they affect cell survival, migration, and attraction.
        Some of the ligands and co-receptors bound by neuropilins are vascular endothelial
        growth factor (VEGF) and semaphorin family members. This protein has also
        been determined to act as a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19)
        to infect host cells. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2020]


        JAG1: The jagged 1 protein encoded by JAG1 is the human homolog of the Drosophilia
        jagged protein. Human jagged 1 is the ligand for the receptor notch 1, the
        latter is involved in signaling processes. Mutations that alter the jagged
        1 protein cause Alagille syndrome. Jagged 1 signalling through notch 1 has
        also been shown to play a role in hematopoiesis. [provided by RefSeq, Nov

        APOH: Apolipoprotein H, also known as beta-2-glycoprotein I, is a component
        of circulating plasma lipoproteins. It has been implicated in a variety of
        physiologic pathways including lipoprotein metabolism, coagulation, hemostasis,
        and the production of antiphospholipid autoantibodies. APOH may be a required
        cofactor for anionic phospholipid binding by the antiphospholipid autoantibodies
        found in sera of many patients with lupus and primary antiphospholipid syndrome
        (APS). The anti-beta (2) glycoprotein I antibodies from APS patients, mediate
        inhibition of activated protein C which has anticoagulant properties. Because
        beta-2-GPI is the main autoantigen in patients with APS, the disruption of
        this pathway by autoantibodies may be an important mechanism for thrombosis
        in patients with APS.[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2019]


        SPP1: The protein encoded by this gene is involved in the attachment of osteoclasts
        to the mineralized bone matrix. The encoded protein is secreted and binds
        hydroxyapatite with high affinity. The osteoclast vitronectin receptor is
        found in the cell membrane and may be involved in the binding to this protein.
        This protein is also a cytokine that upregulates expression of interferon-gamma
        and interleukin-12. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms
        have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2011]


        LPL: LPL encodes lipoprotein lipase, which is expressed in heart, muscle,
        and adipose tissue. LPL functions as a homodimer, and has the dual functions
        of triglyceride hydrolase and ligand/bridging factor for receptor-mediated
        lipoprotein uptake. Severe mutations that cause LPL deficiency result in type
        I hyperlipoproteinemia, while less extreme mutations in LPL are linked to
        many disorders of lipoprotein metabolism. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FGFR1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth
        factor receptor (FGFR) family, where amino acid sequence is highly conserved
        between members and throughout evolution. FGFR family members differ from
        one another in their ligand affinities and tissue distribution. A full-length
        representative protein consists of an extracellular region, composed of three
        immunoglobulin-like domains, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment
        and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular portion of the
        protein interacts with fibroblast growth factors, setting in motion a cascade
        of downstream signals, ultimately influencing mitogenesis and differentiation.
        This particular family member binds both acidic and basic fibroblast growth
        factors and is involved in limb induction. Mutations in this gene have been
        associated with Pfeiffer syndrome, Jackson-Weiss syndrome, Antley-Bixler syndrome,
        osteoglophonic dysplasia, and autosomal dominant Kallmann syndrome 2. Chromosomal
        aberrations involving this gene are associated with stem cell myeloproliferative
        disorder and stem cell leukemia lymphoma syndrome. Alternatively spliced variants
        which encode different protein isoforms have been described; however, not
        all variants have been fully characterized. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        TNFRSF21: This gene encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor
        superfamily. The encoded protein activates nuclear factor kappa-B and mitogen-activated
        protein kinase 8 (also called c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1), and induces cell
        apoptosis. Through its death domain, the encoded receptor interacts with tumor
        necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated death domain (TRADD) protein, which
        is known to mediate signal transduction of tumor necrosis factor receptors.
        Knockout studies in mice suggest that this gene plays a role in T-helper cell
        activation, and may be involved in inflammation and immune regulation. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2013]


        TIMP1: This gene belongs to the TIMP gene family. The proteins encoded by
        this gene family are natural inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
        a group of peptidases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        In addition to its inhibitory role against most of the known MMPs, the encoded
        protein is able to promote cell proliferation in a wide range of cell types,
        and may also have an anti-apoptotic function. Transcription of this gene is
        highly inducible in response to many cytokines and hormones. In addition,
        the expression from some but not all inactive X chromosomes suggests that
        this gene inactivation is polymorphic in human females. This gene is located
        within intron 6 of the synapsin I gene and is transcribed in the opposite
        direction. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        LUM: This gene encodes a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP)
        family that includes decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, keratocan, epiphycan,
        and osteoglycin. In these bifunctional molecules, the protein moiety binds
        collagen fibrils and the highly charged hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans regulate
        interfibrillar spacings. Lumican is the major keratan sulfate proteoglycan
        of the cornea but is also distributed in interstitial collagenous matrices
        throughout the body. Lumican may regulate collagen fibril organization and
        circumferential growth, corneal transparency, and epithelial cell migration
        and tissue repair. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        OLR1: This gene encodes a low density lipoprotein receptor that belongs to
        the C-type lectin superfamily. This gene is regulated through the cyclic AMP
        signaling pathway. The encoded protein binds, internalizes and degrades oxidized
        low-density lipoprotein. This protein may be involved in the regulation of
        Fas-induced apoptosis. This protein may play a role as a scavenger receptor.
        Mutations of this gene have been associated with atherosclerosis, risk of
        myocardial infarction, and may modify the risk of Alzheimer''s disease. Alternate
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Feb
        2010]


        MSX1: This gene encodes a member of the muscle segment homeobox gene family.
        The encoded protein functions as a transcriptional repressor during embryogenesis
        through interactions with components of the core transcription complex and
        other homeoproteins. It may also have roles in limb-pattern formation, craniofacial
        development, particularly odontogenesis, and tumor growth inhibition. Mutations
        in this gene, which was once known as homeobox 7, have been associated with
        nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate 5, Witkop syndrome, Wolf-Hirschom
        syndrome, and autosomoal dominant hypodontia. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        THBD: The protein encoded by this intronless gene is an endothelial-specific
        type I membrane receptor that binds thrombin. This binding results in the
        activation of protein C, which degrades clotting factors Va and VIIIa and
        reduces the amount of thrombin generated. Mutations in this gene are a cause
        of thromboembolic disease, also known as inherited thrombophilia. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ITGAV: The product of this gene belongs to the integrin alpha chain family.
        Integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha
        subunit and a beta subunit that function in cell surface adhesion and signaling.
        The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate light and
        heavy chains that comprise the alpha V subunit. This subunit associates with
        beta 1, beta 3, beta 5, beta 6 and beta 8 subunits. The heterodimer consisting
        of alpha V and beta 3 subunits is also known as the vitronectin receptor.
        This integrin may regulate angiogenesis and cancer progression. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Note that the integrin alpha
        5 and integrin alpha V subunits are encoded by distinct genes. [provided by
        RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        STC1: This gene encodes a secreted, homodimeric glycoprotein that is expressed
        in a wide variety of tissues and may have autocrine or paracrine functions.
        The gene contains a 5'' UTR rich in CAG trinucleotide repeats. The encoded
        protein contains 11 conserved cysteine residues and is phosphorylated by protein
        kinase C exclusively on its serine residues. The protein may play a role in
        the regulation of renal and intestinal calcium and phosphate transport, cell
        metabolism, or cellular calcium/phosphate homeostasis. Overexpression of human
        stanniocalcin 1 in mice produces high serum phosphate levels, dwarfism, and
        increased metabolic rate. This gene has altered expression in hepatocellular,
        ovarian, and breast cancers. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        VTN: The protein encoded by this gene functions in part as an adhesive glycoprotein.
        Differential expression of this protein can promote either cell adhesion or
        migration as it links cells to the extracellular matrix through a variety
        of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1,
        and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be
        present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular
        matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging
        effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpin
        serine protease inhibitors. This protein can also promote extracellular matrix
        degradation and thus plays a role in tumorigenesis. It is involved in a variety
        of other biological processes such as the regulation of the coagulation pathway,
        wound healing, and tissue remodeling. The heparin-binding domain of this protein
        give it anti-microbial properties. It is also a lipid binding protein that
        forms a principal component of high density lipoprotein. [provided by RefSeq,
        Aug 2020]


        JAG2: The Notch signaling pathway is an intercellular signaling mechanism
        that is essential for proper embryonic development. Members of the Notch gene
        family encode transmembrane receptors that are critical for various cell fate
        decisions. The protein encoded by this gene is one of several ligands that
        activate Notch and related receptors. Two transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        SLCO2A1: This gene encodes a prostaglandin transporter that is a member of
        the 12-membrane-spanning superfamily of transporters. The encoded protein
        may be involved in mediating the uptake and clearance of prostaglandins in
        numerous tissues. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]


        POSTN: This gene encodes a secreted extracellular matrix protein that functions
        in tissue development and regeneration, including wound healing, and ventricular
        remodeling following myocardial infarction. The encoded protein binds to integrins
        to support adhesion and migration of epithelial cells. This protein plays
        a role in cancer stem cell maintenance and metastasis. Mice lacking this gene
        exhibit cardiac valve disease, and skeletal and dental defects. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.

        S100A4: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the S100 family of
        proteins containing 2 EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. S100 proteins are localized
        in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, and involved in
        the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression
        and differentiation. S100 genes include at least 13 members which are located
        as a cluster on chromosome 1q21. This protein may function in motility, invasion,
        and tubulin polymerization. Chromosomal rearrangements and altered expression
        of this gene have been implicated in tumor metastasis. Multiple alternatively
        spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified. [provided

        PGLYRP1: Enables peptidoglycan binding activity and peptidoglycan immune receptor
        activity. Involved in antimicrobial humoral immune response mediated by antimicrobial
        peptide; killing of cells of other organism; and response to bacterium. Located
        in extracellular exosome. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        CCND2: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin
        family, whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein
        abundance through the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK kinases.
        Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns which
        contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This cyclin
        forms a complex with CDK4 or CDK6 and functions as a regulatory subunit of
        the complex, whose activity is required for cell cycle G1/S transition. This
        protein has been shown to interact with and be involved in the phosphorylation
        of tumor suppressor protein Rb. Knockout studies of the homologous gene in
        mouse suggest the essential roles of this gene in ovarian granulosa and germ
        cell proliferation. High level expression of this gene was observed in ovarian
        and testicular tumors. Mutations in this gene are associated with megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus
        syndrome 3 (MPPH3). [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2014]


        COL5A2: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar
        collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of
        one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing
        type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers
        composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely
        related to type XI collagen and it is possible that the collagen chains of
        types V and XI constitute a single collagen type with tissue-specific chain
        combinations. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
        types I and II. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FSTL1: This gene encodes a protein with similarity to follistatin, an activin-binding
        protein. It contains an FS module, a follistatin-like sequence containing
        10 conserved cysteine residues. This gene product is thought to be an autoantigen
        associated with rheumatoid arthritis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        APP: This gene encodes a cell surface receptor and transmembrane precursor
        protein that is cleaved by secretases to form a number of peptides. Some of
        these peptides are secreted and can bind to the acetyltransferase complex
        APBB1/TIP60 to promote transcriptional activation, while others form the protein
        basis of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer
        disease. In addition, two of the peptides are antimicrobial peptides, having
        been shown to have bacteriocidal and antifungal activities. Mutations in this
        gene have been implicated in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease and cerebroarterial
        amyloidosis (cerebral amyloid angiopathy). Multiple transcript variants encoding
        several different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq,
        Aug 2014]


        LRPAP1: This gene encodes a protein that interacts with the low density lipoprotein
        (LDL) receptor-related protein and facilitates its proper folding and localization
        by preventing the binding of ligands. Mutations in this gene have been identified
        in individuals with myopia 23. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2013]


        SERPINA5: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the serpin family
        of proteins, a group of proteins that inhibit serine proteases. This gene
        is one in a cluster of serpin genes located on the q arm of chromosome 14.
        This family member is a glycoprotein that can inhibit several serine proteases,
        including protein C and various plasminogen activators and kallikreins, and
        it thus plays diverse roles in hemostasis and thrombosis in multiple organs.
        [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2012]


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expression of some isoforms derived from the AUG start
        codon is regulated by a small upstream open reading frame, which is located
        within an internal ribosome entry site. The levels of VEGF are increased during
        infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
        thus promoting inflammation by facilitating recruitment of inflammatory cells,
        and by increasing the level of angiopoietin II (Ang II), one of two products
        of the SARS-CoV-2 binding target, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
        In turn, Ang II facilitates the elevation of VEGF, thus forming a vicious
        cycle in the release of inflammatory cytokines. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2020]


        VCAN: This gene is a member of the aggrecan/versican proteoglycan family.
        The protein encoded is a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan and is a major
        component of the extracellular matrix. This protein is involved in cell adhesion,
        proliferation, proliferation, migration and angiogenesis and plays a central
        role in tissue morphogenesis and maintenance. Mutations in this gene are the
        cause of Wagner syndrome type 1. Multiple transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2009]


        PTK2: This gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase which is found
        concentrated in the focal adhesions that form between cells growing in the
        presence of extracellular matrix constituents. The encoded protein is a member
        of the FAK subfamily of protein tyrosine kinases but lacks significant sequence
        similarity to kinases from other subfamilies. Activation of this gene may
        be an important early step in cell growth and intracellular signal transduction
        pathways triggered in response to certain neural peptides or to cell interactions
        with the extracellular matrix. Several transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2017]


        PDGFA: This gene encodes a member of the protein family comprised of both
        platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factors
        (VEGF). The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate
        platelet-derived growth factor subunit A, which can homodimerize, or alternatively,
        heterodimerize with the related platelet-derived growth factor subunit B.
        These proteins bind and activate PDGF receptor tyrosine kinases, which play
        a role in a wide range of developmental processes. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        COL3A1: This gene encodes the pro-alpha1 chains of type III collagen, a fibrillar
        collagen that is found in extensible connective tissues such as skin, lung,
        uterus, intestine and the vascular system, frequently in association with
        type I collagen. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos
        syndrome type IV, and with aortic and arterial aneurysms. [provided by R.
        Dalgleish, Feb 2008]


        KCNJ8: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they
        participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded
        by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium
        channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium
        to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins.
        Defects in this gene may be a cause of J-wave syndromes and sudden infant
        death syndrome (SIDS). [provided by RefSeq, May 2012]


        PF4: This gene encodes a member of the CXC chemokine family. This chemokine
        is released from the alpha granules of activated platelets in the form of
        a homotetramer which has high affinity for heparin and is involved in platelet
        aggregation. This protein is chemotactic for numerous other cell type and
        also functions as an inhibitor of hematopoiesis, angiogenesis and T-cell function.
        The protein also exhibits antimicrobial activity against Plasmodium falciparum.

        NRP1: This gene encodes one of two neuropilins, which contain specific protein
        domains which allow them to participate in several different types of signaling
        pathways that control cell migration. Neuropilins contain a large N-terminal
        extracellular domain, made up of complement-binding, coagulation factor V/VIII,
        and meprin domains. These proteins also contains a short membrane-spanning
        domain and a small cytoplasmic domain. Neuropilins bind many ligands and various
        types of co-receptors; they affect cell survival, migration, and attraction.
        Some of the ligands and co-receptors bound by neuropilins are vascular endothelial
        growth factor (VEGF) and semaphorin family members. This protein has also
        been determined to act as a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19)
        to infect host cells. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2020]


        JAG1: The jagged 1 protein encoded by JAG1 is the human homolog of the Drosophilia
        jagged protein. Human jagged 1 is the ligand for the receptor notch 1, the
        latter is involved in signaling processes. Mutations that alter the jagged
        1 protein cause Alagille syndrome. Jagged 1 signalling through notch 1 has
        also been shown to play a role in hematopoiesis. [provided by RefSeq, Nov

        APOH: Apolipoprotein H, also known as beta-2-glycoprotein I, is a component
        of circulating plasma lipoproteins. It has been implicated in a variety of
        physiologic pathways including lipoprotein metabolism, coagulation, hemostasis,
        and the production of antiphospholipid autoantibodies. APOH may be a required
        cofactor for anionic phospholipid binding by the antiphospholipid autoantibodies
        found in sera of many patients with lupus and primary antiphospholipid syndrome
        (APS). The anti-beta (2) glycoprotein I antibodies from APS patients, mediate
        inhibition of activated protein C which has anticoagulant properties. Because
        beta-2-GPI is the main autoantigen in patients with APS, the disruption of
        this pathway by autoantibodies may be an important mechanism for thrombosis
        in patients with APS.[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2019]


        SPP1: The protein encoded by this gene is involved in the attachment of osteoclasts
        to the mineralized bone matrix. The encoded protein is secreted and binds
        hydroxyapatite with high affinity. The osteoclast vitronectin receptor is
        found in the cell membrane and may be involved in the binding to this protein.
        This protein is also a cytokine that upregulates expression of interferon-gamma
        and interleukin-12. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms
        have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2011]


        LPL: LPL encodes lipoprotein lipase, which is expressed in heart, muscle,
        and adipose tissue. LPL functions as a homodimer, and has the dual functions
        of triglyceride hydrolase and ligand/bridging factor for receptor-mediated
        lipoprotein uptake. Severe mutations that cause LPL deficiency result in type
        I hyperlipoproteinemia, while less extreme mutations in LPL are linked to
        many disorders of lipoprotein metabolism. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FGFR1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth
        factor receptor (FGFR) family, where amino acid sequence is highly conserved
        between members and throughout evolution. FGFR family members differ from
        one another in their ligand affinities and tissue distribution. A full-length
        representative protein consists of an extracellular region, composed of three
        immunoglobulin-like domains, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment
        and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular portion of the
        protein interacts with fibroblast growth factors, setting in motion a cascade
        of downstream signals, ultimately influencing mitogenesis and differentiation.
        This particular family member binds both acidic and basic fibroblast growth
        factors and is involved in limb induction. Mutations in this gene have been
        associated with Pfeiffer syndrome, Jackson-Weiss syndrome, Antley-Bixler syndrome,
        osteoglophonic dysplasia, and autosomal dominant Kallmann syndrome 2. Chromosomal
        aberrations involving this gene are associated with stem cell myeloproliferative
        disorder and stem cell leukemia lymphoma syndrome. Alternatively spliced variants
        which encode different protein isoforms have been described; however, not
        all variants have been fully characterized. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        TNFRSF21: This gene encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor
        superfamily. The encoded protein activates nuclear factor kappa-B and mitogen-activated
        protein kinase 8 (also called c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1), and induces cell
        apoptosis. Through its death domain, the encoded receptor interacts with tumor
        necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated death domain (TRADD) protein, which
        is known to mediate signal transduction of tumor necrosis factor receptors.
        Knockout studies in mice suggest that this gene plays a role in T-helper cell
        activation, and may be involved in inflammation and immune regulation. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2013]


        TIMP1: This gene belongs to the TIMP gene family. The proteins encoded by
        this gene family are natural inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
        a group of peptidases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        In addition to its inhibitory role against most of the known MMPs, the encoded
        protein is able to promote cell proliferation in a wide range of cell types,
        and may also have an anti-apoptotic function. Transcription of this gene is
        highly inducible in response to many cytokines and hormones. In addition,
        the expression from some but not all inactive X chromosomes suggests that
        this gene inactivation is polymorphic in human females. This gene is located
        within intron 6 of the synapsin I gene and is transcribed in the opposite
        direction. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        LUM: This gene encodes a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP)
        family that includes decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, keratocan, epiphycan,
        and osteoglycin. In these bifunctional molecules, the protein moiety binds
        collagen fibrils and the highly charged hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans regulate
        interfibrillar spacings. Lumican is the major keratan sulfate proteoglycan
        of the cornea but is also distributed in interstitial collagenous matrices
        throughout the body. Lumican may regulate collagen fibril organization and
        circumferential growth, corneal transparency, and epithelial cell migration
        and tissue repair. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        OLR1: This gene encodes a low density lipoprotein receptor that belongs to
        the C-type lectin superfamily. This gene is regulated through the cyclic AMP
        signaling pathway. The encoded protein binds, internalizes and degrades oxidized
        low-density lipoprotein. This protein may be involved in the regulation of
        Fas-induced apoptosis. This protein may play a role as a scavenger receptor.
        Mutations of this gene have been associated with atherosclerosis, risk of
        myocardial infarction, and may modify the risk of Alzheimer''s disease. Alternate
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Feb
        2010]


        MSX1: This gene encodes a member of the muscle segment homeobox gene family.
        The encoded protein functions as a transcriptional repressor during embryogenesis
        through interactions with components of the core transcription complex and
        other homeoproteins. It may also have roles in limb-pattern formation, craniofacial
        development, particularly odontogenesis, and tumor growth inhibition. Mutations
        in this gene, which was once known as homeobox 7, have been associated with
        nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate 5, Witkop syndrome, Wolf-Hirschom
        syndrome, and autosomoal dominant hypodontia. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        THBD: The protein encoded by this intronless gene is an endothelial-specific
        type I membrane receptor that binds thrombin. This binding results in the
        activation of protein C, which degrades clotting factors Va and VIIIa and
        reduces the amount of thrombin generated. Mutations in this gene are a cause
        of thromboembolic disease, also known as inherited thrombophilia. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ITGAV: The product of this gene belongs to the integrin alpha chain family.
        Integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha
        subunit and a beta subunit that function in cell surface adhesion and signaling.
        The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate light and
        heavy chains that comprise the alpha V subunit. This subunit associates with
        beta 1, beta 3, beta 5, beta 6 and beta 8 subunits. The heterodimer consisting
        of alpha V and beta 3 subunits is also known as the vitronectin receptor.
        This integrin may regulate angiogenesis and cancer progression. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Note that the integrin alpha
        5 and integrin alpha V subunits are encoded by distinct genes. [provided by
        RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        STC1: This gene encodes a secreted, homodimeric glycoprotein that is expressed
        in a wide variety of tissues and may have autocrine or paracrine functions.
        The gene contains a 5'' UTR rich in CAG trinucleotide repeats. The encoded
        protein contains 11 conserved cysteine residues and is phosphorylated by protein
        kinase C exclusively on its serine residues. The protein may play a role in
        the regulation of renal and intestinal calcium and phosphate transport, cell
        metabolism, or cellular calcium/phosphate homeostasis. Overexpression of human
        stanniocalcin 1 in mice produces high serum phosphate levels, dwarfism, and
        increased metabolic rate. This gene has altered expression in hepatocellular,
        ovarian, and breast cancers. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        VTN: The protein encoded by this gene functions in part as an adhesive glycoprotein.
        Differential expression of this protein can promote either cell adhesion or
        migration as it links cells to the extracellular matrix through a variety
        of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1,
        and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be
        present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular
        matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging
        effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpin
        serine protease inhibitors. This protein can also promote extracellular matrix
        degradation and thus plays a role in tumorigenesis. It is involved in a variety
        of other biological processes such as the regulation of the coagulation pathway,
        wound healing, and tissue remodeling. The heparin-binding domain of this protein
        give it anti-microbial properties. It is also a lipid binding protein that
        forms a principal component of high density lipoprotein. [provided by RefSeq,
        Aug 2020]


        JAG2: The Notch signaling pathway is an intercellular signaling mechanism
        that is essential for proper embryonic development. Members of the Notch gene
        family encode transmembrane receptors that are critical for various cell fate
        decisions. The protein encoded by this gene is one of several ligands that
        activate Notch and related receptors. Two transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        SLCO2A1: This gene encodes a prostaglandin transporter that is a member of
        the 12-membrane-spanning superfamily of transporters. The encoded protein
        may be involved in mediating the uptake and clearance of prostaglandins in
        numerous tissues. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]


        POSTN: This gene encodes a secreted extracellular matrix protein that functions
        in tissue development and regeneration, including wound healing, and ventricular
        remodeling following myocardial infarction. The encoded protein binds to integrins
        to support adhesion and migration of epithelial cells. This protein plays
        a role in cancer stem cell maintenance and metastasis. Mice lacking this gene
        exhibit cardiac valve disease, and skeletal and dental defects. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.

        S100A4: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the S100 family of
        proteins containing 2 EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. S100 proteins are localized
        in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, and involved in
        the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression
        and differentiation. S100 genes include at least 13 members which are located
        as a cluster on chromosome 1q21. This protein may function in motility, invasion,
        and tubulin polymerization. Chromosomal rearrangements and altered expression
        of this gene have been implicated in tumor metastasis. Multiple alternatively
        spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified. [provided

        abundance through the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK kinases.
        Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns which
        contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This cyclin
        forms a complex with CDK4 or CDK6 and functions as a regulatory subunit of
        the complex, whose activity is required for cell cycle G1/S transition. This

        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expr...

        peptide; killing of cells of other organism...


        CCND2: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin
        family, whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein
        abundance through the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK kinases.
        Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns which
        contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This cyclin
        forms a complex with CDK4 or CDK6 and functions as a regulatory subunit of
        the complex, whose activity is required for cell cycle G1/S transition. This
        protein has been shown to interact with and be involved in the phosphorylation
        of tumor suppressor protein Rb. Knock...


        COL5A2: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar
        collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of
        one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing
        type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers
        composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely
        related to type XI collagen and it is pos...


        FSTL1: This gene encodes a protein with similarity to follistatin, an activin-binding
        protein. It contains an FS module, a follistatin-like sequence containing
        10 conserved cysteine residues. This gen...


        APP: This gene encodes a cell surface receptor and transmembrane precursor
        protein that is cleaved by secretases to form a number of peptides. Some of
        these peptides are secreted and can bind to the acetyltransferase complex
        APBB1/TIP60 to promote transcriptional activation, while others form the protein
        basis of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer
        disease. In addition, two of the peptides are antimicrobial peptides, having
        been shown to have bacteriocidal and antifungal a...


        LRPAP1: This gene encodes a protein that interacts with the low density lipoprotein
        (LDL) receptor-related protein and facilitates its proper folding and localization
        by preventing the binding of ligands. Mutations in this gene have been id...

        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expr...

        also functions a...


        NRP1: This gene encodes one of two neuropilins, which contain specific protein
        domains which allow them to participate in several different types of signaling
        pathways that control cell migration. Neuropilins contain a large N-terminal
        extracellular domain, made up of complement-binding, coagulation factor V/VIII,
        and meprin domains. These proteins also contains a short membrane-spanning
        domain and a small cytoplasmic domain. Neuropilins bind many ligands and various
        types of co-receptors; they affect cell survival, migration, and ...


        JAG1: The jagged 1 protein encoded by JAG1 is the human homolog of the Drosophilia
        jagged protein. Human jagged 1 is the ligand for the receptor notch 1, the

        1 protein cause ...


        APOH: Apolipoprotein H, also known as beta-2-glycoprotein I, is a component
        of circulating plasma lipoproteins. It has been implicated in a variety of
        physiologic pathways including lipoprotein metabolism, coagulation, hemostasis,
        and the production of antiphospholipid autoantibodies. APOH may be a required
        cofactor for anionic phospholipid binding by the antiphospholipid autoantibodies
        found in sera of many patients with lupus and primary antiphospholipid syndrome
        (APS). The anti-beta (2) glycoprotein I antibodies from APS pa...

        and adipose tissue. LPL functions as a homodimer, and has the dual functions
        of triglyceride hydrolase and ligand/bridging factor for receptor-mediated
        lipoprotein uptake. Severe mutations that cause LPL deficiency ...


        FGFR1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth
        factor receptor (FGFR) family, where amino acid sequence is highly conserved
        between members and throughout evolution. FGFR family members differ from
        one another in their ligand affinities and tissue distribution. A full-length
        representative protein consists of an extracellular region, composed of three
        immunoglobulin-like domains, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment
        and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular portion of the
        protein interacts with fibroblast growth factors, setting in motion a cascade
        of downstream signals, ultimately influencing mitogenesis and differentiation.
        This particular family member binds both acidic and basic fibroblast growth
        factors and is involved in limb induction. Mutations in this gene have been
        ass...


        TNFRSF21: This gene encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor
        superfamily. The encoded protein activates nuclear factor kappa-B and mitogen-activated
        protein kinase 8 (also called c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1), and induces cell
        apoptosis. Through its death domain, the encoded receptor interacts with tumor
        necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated death domain (TRADD) protein, which
        is known to mediate sign...


        TIMP1: This gene belongs to the TIMP gene family. The proteins encoded by
        this gene family are natural inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
        a group of peptidases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        In addition to its inhibitory role against most of the known MMPs, the encoded
        protein is able to promote cell proliferation in a wide range of cell types,
        and may also have an anti-apoptotic function. Transcription of this gene is
        highly inducible in response to many cytokines and ho...


        LUM: This gene encodes a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP)
        family that includes decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, keratocan, epiphycan,
        and osteoglycin. In these bifunctional molecules, the protein moiety binds
        collagen fibrils and the highly charged hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans regulate
        interfibrillar spacings. Lumican is the major keratan sulfate proteoglycan
        of the cornea but is also distributed i...

        the regulation of renal and intestinal calcium and phosphate transport, cell
        metabolism, or cellula...


        VTN: The protein encoded by this gene functions in part as an adhesive glycoprotein.
        Differential expression of this protein can promote either cell adhesion or
        migration as it links cells to the extracellular matrix through a variety
        of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1,
        and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be
        present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular
        matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging

        CCND2: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin
        family, whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein
        abundance through the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK kinases.
        Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns which
        contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This cyclin
        forms a complex with CDK4 or CDK6 and functions as a regulatory subunit of
        the complex, whose activity is required for cell cycle G1/S transition. This
        protein has been shown to interact with and be involved in the phosphorylation
        of tumor suppressor protein Rb. Knock...


        COL5A2: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar
        collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of
        one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing
        type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers
        composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely
        related to type XI collagen and it is pos...

        10 conserved cysteine residues. This gen...


        APP: This gene encodes a cell surface receptor and transmembrane precursor
        protein that is cleaved by secretases to form a number of peptides. Some of
        these peptides are secreted and can bind to the acetyltransferase complex
        APBB1/TIP60 to promote transcriptional activation, while others form the protein
        basis of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer
        disease. In addition, two of the peptides are antimicrobial peptides, having
        been shown to have bacteriocidal and antifungal a...


        LRPAP1: This gene encodes a protein that interacts with the low density lipoprotein
        (LDL) receptor-related protein and facilitates its proper folding and localization

        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expr...

        and meprin domains. These proteins also contains a short membrane-spanning
        domain and a small cytoplasmic domain. Neuropilins bind many ligands and various
        types of co-receptors; they affect cell survival, migration, and ...


        JAG1: The jagged 1 protein encoded by JAG1 is the human homolog of the Drosophilia

        1 protein cause ...


        APOH: Apolipoprotein H, also known as beta-2-glycoprotein I, is a component
        of circulating plasma lipoproteins. It has been implicated in a variety of
        physiologic pathways including lipoprotein metabolism, coagulation, hemostasis,
        and the production of antiphospholipid autoantibodies. APOH may be a required
        cofactor for anionic phospholipid binding by the antiphospholipid autoantibodies
        found in sera of many patients with lupus and primary antiphospholipid syndrome
        (APS). The anti-beta (2) glycoprotein I antibodies from APS pa...

        and adipose tissue. LPL functions as a homodimer, and has the dual functions
        of triglyceride hydrolase and ligand/bridging factor for receptor-mediated
        lipoprotein uptake. Severe mutations that cause LPL deficiency ...


        FGFR1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth
        factor receptor (FGFR) family, where amino acid sequence is highly conserved
        between members and throughout evolution. FGFR family members differ from
        one another in their ligand affinities and tissue distribution. A full-length
        representative protein consists of an extracellular region, composed of three
        immunoglobulin-like domains, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment
        and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular portion of the
        protein interacts with fibroblast growth factors, setting in motion a cascade
        of downstream signals, ultimately influencing mitogenesis and differentiation.

        protein is able to promote cell proliferation in a wide range of cell types,
        and may also have an anti-apoptotic function. Transcription of this gene is
        highly inducible in response to many cytokines and ho...

        CCND2: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin
        family, whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein
        abundance through the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK kinases.
        Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns which
        contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This cyclin
        forms a complex with CDK4 or CDK6 and functions as a regulatory subunit of
        the complex, whose activity is required for cell cycle G1/S transition. This
        protein has been shown to interact with and be involved in the phosphorylation
        of tumor suppressor protein Rb. Knock...


        COL5A2: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar

        APBB1/TIP60 to promote transcriptional activation, while others form the protein
        basis of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer
        disease. In addition, two of the peptides are antimicrobial peptides, having
        been shown to have bacteriocidal and antifungal a...


        LRPAP1: This gene encodes a protein that interacts with the low density lipoprotein
        (LDL) receptor-related protein and facilitates its proper folding and localization

        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expr...

        1 protein cause ...


        APOH: Apolipoprotein H, also known as beta-2-glycoprotein I, is a component
        of circulating plasma lipoproteins. It has been implicated in a variety of
        physiologic pathways including lipoprotein metabolism, coagulation, hemostasis,
        and the production of antiphospholipid autoantibodies. APOH may be a required
        cofactor for anionic phospholipid binding by the antiphospholipid autoantibodies
        found in sera of many patients with lupus and primary antiphospholipid syndrome
        (APS). The anti-beta (2) glycoprotein I antibodies from APS pa...

        lipoprotein uptake. Severe mutations that cause LPL deficiency ...


        FGFR1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth
        factor receptor (FGFR) family, where amino acid sequence is highly conserved
        between members and throughout evolution. FGFR family members differ from
        one another in their ligand affinities and tissue distribution. A full-length
        representative protein consists of an extracellular region, composed of three
        immunoglobulin-like domains, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment
        and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular portion of the
        protein interacts with fibroblast growth factors, setting in motion a cascade
        of downstream signals, ultimately influencing mitogenesis and differentiation.
        This particular family member binds both acidic and basic fibroblast growth
        factors and is involved in limb induction. Mutations in this gene have been
        ass...


        TNFRSF21: This gene encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor
        superfamily. The encoded protein activates nuclear factor kappa-B and mitogen-activated
        protein kinase 8 (also called c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1), and induces cell
        apoptosis. Through its death domain, the encoded receptor interacts with tumor
        necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated death domain (TRADD) protein, which
        is known to mediate sign...

        protein is able to promote cell proliferation in a wide range of cell types,
        and may also have an anti-apoptotic function. Transcription of this gene is
        highly inducible in response to many cytokines and ho...


        LUM: This gene encodes a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP)
        family that includes decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, keratocan, epiphycan,
        and osteoglycin. In these bifunctional molecules, the protein moiety binds
        collagen fibrils and the highly charged hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans regulate
        interfibrillar spacings. Lumican is the major keratan sulfate proteoglycan
        of the cornea but is also distributed i...
