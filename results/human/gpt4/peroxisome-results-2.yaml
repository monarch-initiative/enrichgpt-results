          Here are the gene summaries:


          PEX1: This gene encodes a member of the AAA ATPase family, a large group of ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities. This protein is cytoplasmic but is often anchored to a peroxisomal membrane where it forms a heteromeric complex and plays a role in the import of proteins into peroxisomes and peroxisome biogenesis. Mutations in this gene have been associated with complementation group 1 peroxisomal disorders such as neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile Refsum disease, and Zellweger syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]

          PEX2: This gene encodes an integral peroxisomal membrane protein required for peroxisome biogenesis. The protein is thought to be involved in peroxisomal matrix protein import. Mutations in this gene result in one form of Zellweger syndrome and infantile Refsum disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          PEX3: The product of this gene is involved in peroxisome biosynthesis and integrity. It assembles membrane vesicles before the matrix proteins are translocated. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause Zellweger syndrome (ZWS). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          PEX5: The product of this gene binds to the C-terminal PTS1-type tripeptide peroxisomal targeting signal (SKL-type) and plays an essential role in peroxisomal protein import. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause of neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), a cause of Zellweger syndrome (ZWS) as well as may be a cause of infantile Refsum disease (IRD). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          PEX6: This gene encodes a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) family of ATPases. This member is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, which plays a direct role in peroxisomal protein import and is required for PTS1 (peroxisomal targeting signal 1, a C-terminal tripeptide of the sequence ser-lys-leu) receptor activity. Mutations in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders of complementation group 4 and complementation group 6. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]

          PEX7: This gene encodes the cytosolic receptor for the set of peroxisomal matrix enzymes targeted to the organelle by the peroxisome targeting signal 2 (PTS2). Defects in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), which are characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. There are at least 14 complementation groups for PBDs, with more than one phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene have been associated with PBD complementation group 11 (PBD-CG11) disorders, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 (RCDP1), and Refsum disease (RD).

          PEX5: The product of this gene binds to the C-terminal PTS1-type tripeptide peroxisomal targeting signal (SKL-type) and plays an essential role in peroxisomal protein import. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause of neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), a cause of Zellweger syndrome (ZWS) as well as may be a cause of infantile Refsum disease (IRD). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          PEX6: This gene encodes a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) family of ATPases. This member is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, which plays a direct role in peroxisomal protein import and is required for PTS1 (peroxisomal targeting signal 1, a C-terminal tripeptide of the sequence ser-lys-leu) receptor activity. Mutations in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders of complementation group 4 and complementation group 6. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]

          PEX7: This gene encodes the cytosolic receptor for the set of peroxisomal matrix enzymes targeted to the organelle by the peroxisome targeting signal 2 (PTS2). Defects in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), which are characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. There are at least 14 complementation groups for PBDs, with more than one phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene have been associated with PBD complementation group 11 (PBD-CG11) disorders, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 (RCDP1), and Refsum disease (RD).

          Here are the gene summaries:


          PEX1: This gene encodes a member of the AAA ATPase family, a large group of ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities. This protein is cytoplasmic but is often anchored to a peroxisomal membrane where it forms a heteromeric complex and plays a role in the import of proteins into peroxisomes and peroxisome biogenesis. Mutations in this gene have been associated with complementation group 1 peroxisomal disorders such as neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile Refsum disease, and Zellweger syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]

          PEX2: This gene encodes an integral peroxisomal membrane protein required for peroxisome biogenesis. The protein is thought to be involved in peroxisomal matrix protein import. Mutations in this gene result in one form of Zellweger syndrome and infantile Refsum disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          PEX3: The product of this gene is involved in peroxisome biosynthesis and integrity. It assembles membrane vesicles before the matrix proteins are translocated. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause Zellweger syndrome (ZWS). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          PEX5: The product of this gene binds to the C-terminal PTS1-type tripeptide peroxisomal targeting signal (SKL-type) and plays an essential role in peroxisomal protein import. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause of neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), a cause of Zellweger syndrome (ZWS) as well as may be a cause of infantile Refsum disease (IRD). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          PEX6: This gene encodes a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) family of ATPases. This member is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, which plays a direct role in peroxisomal protein import and is required for PTS1 (peroxisomal targeting signal 1, a C-terminal tripeptide of the sequence ser-lys-leu) receptor activity. Mutations in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders of complementation group 4 and complementation group 6. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]

          PEX7: This gene encodes the cytosolic receptor for the set of peroxisomal matrix enzymes targeted to the organelle by the peroxisome targeting signal 2 (PTS2). Defects in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), which are characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. There are at least 14 complementation groups for PBDs, with more than one phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene have been associated with PBD complementation group 11 (PBD-CG11) disorders, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 (RCDP1), and Refsum disease (RD).

Therefore, these genes are involved in the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins and the maturation of peroxisomes. The commonalities in their function are related to their roles in peroxisome biogenesis and protein import.

          Here are the gene summaries:


          PEX1: This gene encodes a member of the AAA ATPase family, a large group of ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities. This protein is cytoplasmic but is often anchored to a peroxisomal membrane where it forms a heteromeric complex and plays a role in the import of proteins into peroxisomes and peroxisome biogenesis. Mutations in this gene have been associated with complementation group 1 peroxisomal disorders such as neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile Refsum disease, and Zellweger syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]

          PEX2: This gene encodes an integral peroxisomal membrane protein required for peroxisome biogenesis. The protein is thought to be involved in peroxisomal matrix protein import. Mutations in this gene result in one form of Zellweger syndrome and infantile Refsum disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          PEX3: The product of this gene is involved in peroxisome biosynthesis and integrity. It assembles membrane vesicles before the matrix proteins are translocated. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause Zellweger syndrome (ZWS). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          PEX5: The product of this gene binds to the C-terminal PTS1-type tripeptide peroxisomal targeting signal (SKL-type) and plays an essential role in peroxisomal protein import. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause of neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), a cause of Zellweger syndrome (ZWS) as well as may be a cause of infantile Refsum disease (IRD). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          PEX6: This gene encodes a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) family of ATPases. This member is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, which plays a direct role in peroxisomal protein import and is required for PTS1 (peroxisomal targeting signal 1, a C-terminal tripeptide of the sequence ser-lys-leu) receptor activity. Mutations in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders of complementation group 4 and complementation group 6. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]

          PEX7: This gene encodes the cytosolic receptor for the set of peroxisomal matrix enzymes targeted to the organelle by the peroxisome targeting signal 2 (PTS2). Defects in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), which are characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. There are at least 14 complementation groups for PBDs, with more than one phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene have been associated with PBD complementation group 11 (PBD-CG11) disorders, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 (RCDP1), and Refsum disease (RD).

          Here are the gene summaries:


          PEX1: This gene encodes a member of the AAA ATPase family, a large group of ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities. This protein is cytoplasmic but is often anchored to a peroxisomal membrane where it forms a heteromeric complex and plays a role in the import of proteins into peroxisomes and peroxisome biogenesis. Mutations in this gene have been associated with complementation group 1 peroxisomal disorders such as neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile Refsum disease, and Zellweger syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]

          PEX2: This gene encodes an integral peroxisomal membrane protein required for peroxisome biogenesis. The protein is thought to be involved in peroxisomal matrix protein import. Mutations in this gene result in one form of Zellweger syndrome and infantile Refsum disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          PEX3: The product of this gene is involved in peroxisome biosynthesis and integrity. It assembles membrane vesicles before the matrix proteins are translocated. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause Zellweger syndrome (ZWS). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          PEX5: The product of this gene binds to the C-terminal PTS1-type tripeptide peroxisomal targeting signal (SKL-type) and plays an essential role in peroxisomal protein import. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause of neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), a cause of Zellweger syndrome (ZWS) as well as may be a cause of infantile Refsum disease (IRD). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          PEX6: This gene encodes a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) family of ATPases. This member is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, which plays a direct role in peroxisomal protein import and is required for PTS1 (peroxisomal targeting signal 1, a C-terminal tripeptide of the sequence ser-lys-leu) receptor activity. Mutations in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders of complementation group 4 and complementation group 6. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]

          PEX7: This gene encodes the cytosolic receptor for the set of peroxisomal matrix enzymes targeted to the organelle by the peroxisome targeting signal 2 (PTS2). Defects in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), which are characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. There are at least 14 complementation groups for PBDs, with more than one phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene have been associated with PBD complementation group 11 (PBD-CG11) disorders, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 (RCDP1), and Refsum disease (RD).

          Here are the gene summaries:


          PEX6: This gene encodes a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) family of ATPases. This member is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, which plays a direct role in peroxisomal protein import and is required for PTS1 (peroxisomal targeting signal 1, a C-terminal tripeptide of the sequence ser-lys-leu) receptor activity. Mutations in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders of complementation group 4 and complementation group 6. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]

          PEX7: This gene encodes the cytosolic receptor for the set of peroxisomal matrix enzymes targeted to the organelle by the peroxisome targeting signal 2 (PTS2). Defects in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), which are characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. There are at least 14 complementation groups for PBDs, with more than one phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene have been associated with PBD complementation group 11 (PBD-CG11) disorders, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 (RCDP1), and Refsum disease (RD). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          PEX3: The product of this gene is involved in peroxisome biosynthesis and integrity. It assembles membrane vesicles before the matrix proteins are translocated. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause Zellweger syndrome (ZWS). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          PEX5: The product of this gene binds to the C-terminal PTS1-type tripeptide peroxisomal targeting signal (SKL-type) and plays an essential role in peroxisomal protein import. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause of neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), a cause of Zellweger syndrome (ZWS) as well as may be a cause of infantile Refsum disease (IRD). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          PEX2: This gene encodes an integral peroxisomal membrane protein required for peroxisome biogenesis. The protein is thought to be involved in peroxisomal matrix protein import. Mutations in this gene result in one form of Zellweger syndrome and infantile Refsum disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein.

          Here are the gene summaries:


          PEX6: This gene encodes a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) family of ATPases. This member is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, which plays a direct role in peroxisomal protein import and is required for PTS1 (peroxisomal targeting signal 1, a C-terminal tripeptide of the sequence ser-lys-leu) receptor activity. Mutations in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders of complementation group 4 and complementation group 6. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]

          PEX7: This gene encodes the cytosolic receptor for the set of peroxisomal matrix enzymes targeted to the organelle by the peroxisome targeting signal 2 (PTS2). Defects in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), which are characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. There are at least 14 complementation groups for PBDs, with more than one phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene have been associated with PBD complementation group 11 (PBD-CG11) disorders, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 (RCDP1), and Refsum disease (RD). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          PEX3: The product of this gene is involved in peroxisome biosynthesis and integrity. It assembles membrane vesicles before the matrix proteins are translocated. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause Zellweger syndrome (ZWS). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          PEX5: The product of this gene binds to the C-terminal PTS1-type tripeptide peroxisomal targeting signal (SKL-type) and plays an essential role in peroxisomal protein import. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function.

Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause of neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), a cause of Zellweger syndrome (ZWS) as well as may be a cause of infantile Refsum disease (IRD). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          PEX2: This gene encodes an integral peroxisomal membrane protein required for peroxisome biogenesis. The protein is thought to be involved in peroxisomal matrix protein import. Mutations in this gene result in one form of Zellweger syndrome and infantile Refsum disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein.

          Here are the gene summaries:


          PEX6: This gene encodes a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) family of ATPases. This member is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, which plays a direct role in peroxisomal protein import and is required for PTS1 (peroxisomal targeting signal 1, a C-terminal tripeptide of the sequence ser-lys-leu) receptor activity. Mutations in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders of complementation group 4 and complementation group 6. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]

          PEX7: This gene encodes the cytosolic receptor for the set of peroxisomal matrix enzymes targeted to the organelle by the peroxisome targeting signal 2 (PTS2). Defects in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), which are characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. There are at least 14 complementation groups for PBDs, with more than one phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene have been associated with PBD complementation group 11 (PBD-CG11) disorders, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 (RCDP1), and Refsum disease (RD). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          PEX3: The product of this gene is involved in peroxisome biosynthesis and integrity. It assembles membrane vesicles before the matrix proteins are translocated. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function. The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause Zellweger syndrome (ZWS). [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          PEX5: The product of this gene binds to the C-terminal PTS1-type tripeptide peroxisomal targeting signal (SKL-type) and plays an essential role in peroxisomal protein import. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of functional peroxisomes. The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive, lethal diseases characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function.

Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle. Defects in this gene are a cause of neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), a cause of Zellweger syndrome (ZWS) as well as may be a cause of infantile Refsum disease (IRD). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]

          PEX2: This gene encodes an integral peroxisomal membrane protein required for peroxisome biogenesis. The protein is thought to be involved in peroxisomal matrix protein import. Mutations in this gene result in one form of Zellweger syndrome and infantile Refsum disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein.
