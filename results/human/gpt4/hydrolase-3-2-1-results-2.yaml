          Summary: The enriched terms are centered around the catabolism of complex carbohydrates, specifically glycosphingolipids, glycoproteins, and chitin, as well as the breakdown of hyaluronan.

          Mechanism: The genes with enriched functions are involved in various steps of complex carbohydrate catabolism, including enzymatic breakdown of specific glycosyl bonds and trimming of terminally located mannose and glucose residues. These processes likely occur in intracellular membrane-bound organelles, such as lysosomes.

          Enriched Terms: glycosphingolipid catabolic process; glycoprotein catabolic process; chitin catabolic process; hyaluronan catabolic process.

          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"

          Summary and enriched terms:
        response_text: |4-
           The genes in the list are involved in many processes relating to glycan metabolism and synthesis, such as glycoside catabolic process, glycosaminoglycan catabolic process, glycolipid catabolic process, glycogen catabolic process, and sucrose catabolic process. Other enriched terms are dihydroceramidase activity, hyaluronic acid binding activity, hyalurononglucosaminidase activity, hyaluronan metabolic process, L-arabinose metabolic process, mannosyl-oligosaccharide 1,2-alpha-mannosidase activity, protein N-linked glycosylation, and protein homodimerization activity.

          Mechanism: Glycan metabolism and synthesis involves several enzymes with diverse activities such as alpha-glucosidases, alpha-mannosidases, beta-glucosidases, beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases, and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases. These enzymes hydrolyze and transfer carbohydrate building blocks to form and modify carbohydrates for a variety of cellular functions.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          Summary and enriched terms:
        response_text: |-
          Summary: The enriched terms for these genes suggest a common function in lysosomal and glycosylation-related processes. 

          Mechanism: These genes encode for enzymes involved in lysosomal degradation of various glycoconjugates, including gangliosides, glycoproteins, and glycans. This degradation process involves stepwise hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkages via a variety of glycoside hydrolase enzymes. 

          Enriched Terms: Lysosomal catabolic process; monosaccharide metabolic process; glycoside hydrolase activity; hexose metabolic process; carbohydrate binding; ganglioside catabolic process; sialidase activity; N-glycan processing. 

          Hypothesis: Given the enrichment of gene functions in lysosomal and glycosylation-related processes, it is probable that these genes are involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the turnover and localization of various glycoconjugates, thereby contributing to cellular signaling and immune responses. Dysfunction of these genes has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various lysosomal storage disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

          The identified human genes are involved in the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds and the degradation of glycosaminoglycans and hyaluronan, which are components of extracellular matrices and cell walls of fungi. These genes are associated with various reactions such as enzyme hydrolysis, N-glycan biosynthesis, alpha-glucosidase, beta-hexosaminidase, and beta-galactosidase activities. These activities are involved in processes such as cell adhesion, myelination, glycolysis, and N-glycan trimming.

          Mechanism: The hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds and the degradation of glycosaminoglycans and hyaluronan are dependent on the activity of hydrolases such as glycosidases, alpha-amylases, hyaluronidases and lysozymes. These enzymes are involved in various reactions to degrade or cut molecules such as carbohydrates, carbohydrates with protein or lipid modifications, and galactosides.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.
