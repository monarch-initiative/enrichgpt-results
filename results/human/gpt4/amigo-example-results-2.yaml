          Here are the gene summaries:


          APOH: Apolipoprotein H, also known as beta-2-glycoprotein I, is a component of circulating plasma lipoproteins. It has been implicated in a variety of physiologic pathways including lipoprotein metabolism, coagulation, hemostasis, and the production of antiphospholipid autoantibodies. APOH may be a required cofactor for anionic phospholipid binding by the antiphospholipid autoantibodies found in sera of many patients with lupus and primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The anti-beta (2) glycoprotein I antibodies from APS patients, mediate inhibition of activated protein C which has anticoagulant properties. Because beta-2-GPI is the main autoantigen in patients with APS, the disruption of this pathway by autoantibodies may be an important mechanism for thrombosis in patients with APS.[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2019]

          APP: This gene encodes a cell surface receptor and transmembrane precursor protein that is cleaved by secretases to form a number of peptides. Some of these peptides are secreted and can bind to the acetyltransferase complex APBB1/TIP60 to promote transcriptional activation, while others form the protein basis of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease. In addition, two of the peptides are antimicrobial peptides, having been shown to have bacteriocidal and antifungal activities. Mutations in this gene have been implicated in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease and cerebroarterial amyloidosis (cerebral amyloid angiopathy). Multiple transcript variants encoding several different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2014]

          COL3A1: This gene encodes the pro-alpha1 chains of type III collagen, a fibrillar collagen that is found in extensible connective tissues such as skin, lung, uterus, intestine and the vascular system, frequently in association with type I collagen. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, and with aortic and arterial aneurysms. [provided by R. Dalgleish, Feb 2008]

          COL5A2: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely related to type XI collagen and it is possible that the collagen chains of types V and XI constitute a single collagen type with tissue-specific chain combinations. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, types I and II. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          CXCL6: The protein encoded by this gene is a member CXC chemokine family. The encoded protein is a chemotactic for neutrophil granulocytes and has antibacterial action against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. This gene and other members of the CXC chemokine gene family form a gene cluster in a region of chromosome 4q. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2020]

          FGFR1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family, where amino acid sequence is highly conserved between members and throughout evolution. FGFR family members differ from one another in their ligand affinities and tissue distribution. A full-length representative protein consists of an extracellular region, composed of three immunoglobulin-like domains, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular portion of the protein interacts with fibroblast growth factors, setting in motion a cascade of downstream signals, ultimately influencing mitogenesis and differentiation. This particular family member binds both acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors and is involved in limb induction. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Pfeiffer syndrome, Jackson-Weiss syndrome, Antley-Bixler syndrome, osteoglophonic dysplasia, and autosomal dominant Kallmann syndrome 2. Chromosomal aberrations involving this gene are associated with stem cell myeloproliferative disorder and stem cell leukemia lymphoma syndrome. Alternatively spliced variants which encode different protein isoforms have been described; however, not all variants have been fully characterized. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          FSTL1: This gene encodes a protein with similarity to follistatin, an activin-binding protein. It contains an FS module, a follistatin-like sequence containing 10 conserved cysteine residues. This gene product is thought to be an autoantigen associated with rheumatoid arthritis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          ITGAV: The product of this gene belongs to the integrin alpha chain family. Integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha subunit and a beta subunit that function in cell surface adhesion and signaling. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate light and heavy chains that comprise the alpha V subunit. This subunit associates with beta 1, beta 3, beta 5, beta 6 and beta 8 subunits. The heterodimer consisting of alpha V and beta 3 subunits is also known as the vitronectin receptor. This integrin may regulate angiogenesis and cancer progression. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Note that the integrin alpha 5 and integrin alpha V subunits are encoded by distinct genes. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]

          JAG1: The jagged 1 protein encoded by JAG1 is the human homolog of the Drosophilia jagged protein. Human jagged 1 is the ligand for the receptor notch 1, the latter is involved in signaling processes. Mutations that alter the jagged 1 protein cause Alagille syndrome. Jagged 1 signalling through notch 1 has also been shown to play a role in hematopoiesis. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2019]

          JAG2: The Notch signaling pathway is an intercellular signaling mechanism that is essential for proper embryonic development. Members of the Notch gene family encode transmembrane receptors that are critical for various cell fate decisions. The protein encoded by this gene is one of several ligands that activate Notch and related receptors. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          KCNJ8: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins. Defects in this gene may be a cause of J-wave syndromes and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). [provided by RefSeq, May 2012]

          LPL: LPL encodes lipoprotein lipase, which is expressed in heart, muscle, and adipose tissue. LPL functions as a homodimer, and has the dual functions of triglyceride hydrolase and ligand/bridging factor for receptor-mediated lipoprotein uptake. Severe mutations that cause LPL deficiency result in type I hyperlipoproteinemia, while less extreme mutations in LPL are linked to many disorders of lipoprotein metabolism. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          LRPAP1: This gene encodes a protein that interacts with the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein and facilitates its proper folding and localization by preventing the binding of ligands. Mutations in this gene have been identified in individuals with myopia 23. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2013]

          LUM: This gene encodes a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family that includes decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, keratocan, epiphycan, and osteoglycin. In these bifunctional molecules, the protein moiety binds collagen fibrils and the highly charged hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans regulate interfibrillar spacings. Lumican is the major keratan sulfate proteoglycan of the cornea but is also distributed in interstitial collagenous matrices throughout the body. Lumican may regulate collagen fibril organization and circumferential growth, corneal transparency, and epithelial cell migration and tissue repair. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          MSX1: This gene encodes a member of the muscle segment homeobox gene family. The encoded protein functions as a transcriptional repressor during embryogenesis through interactions with components of the core transcription complex and other homeoproteins. It may also have roles in limb-pattern formation, craniofacial development, particularly odontogenesis, and tumor growth inhibition. Mutations in this gene, which was once known as homeobox 7, have been associated with nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate 5, Witkop syndrome, Wolf-Hirschom syndrome, and autosomoal dominant hypodontia. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          NRP1: This gene encodes one of two neuropilins, which contain specific protein domains which allow them to participate in several different types of signaling pathways that control cell migration. Neuropilins contain a large N-terminal extracellular domain, made up of complement-binding, coagulation factor V/VIII, and meprin domains. These proteins also contains a short membrane-spanning domain and a small cytoplasmic domain. Neuropilins bind many ligands and various types of co-receptors; they affect cell survival, migration, and attraction. Some of the ligands and co-receptors bound by neuropilins are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and semaphorin family members. This protein has also been determined to act as a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19) to infect host cells. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2020]

          OLR1: This gene encodes a low density lipoprotein receptor that belongs to the C-type lectin superfamily. This gene is regulated through the cyclic AMP signaling pathway. The encoded protein binds, internalizes and degrades oxidized low-density lipoprotein. This protein may be involved in the regulation of Fas-induced apoptosis. This protein may play a role as a scavenger receptor. Mutations of this gene have been associated with atherosclerosis, risk of myocardial infarction, and may modify the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Feb 2010]

          PDGFA: This gene encodes a member of the protein family comprised of both platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF). The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate platelet-derived growth factor subunit A, which can homodimerize, or alternatively, heterodimerize with the related platelet-derived growth factor subunit B. These proteins bind and activate PDGF receptor tyrosine kinases, which play a role in a wide range of developmental processes. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]

          PF4: This gene encodes a member of the CXC chemokine family. This chemokine is released from the alpha granules of activated platelets in the form of a homotetramer which has high affinity for heparin and is involved in platelet aggregation.

[provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          POSTN: This gene encodes a secreted extracellular matrix protein that functions in tissue development and regeneration, including wound healing, and ventricular remodeling following myocardial infarction. The encoded protein binds to integrins to support adhesion and migration of epithelial cells. This protein plays a role in cancer stem cell maintenance and metastasis. Mice lacking this gene exhibit cardiac valve disease, and skeletal and dental defects. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]

          PRG2: The protein encoded by this gene is the predominant constituent of the crystalline core of the eosinophil granule. High levels of the proform of this protein are also present in placenta and pregnancy serum, where it exists as a complex with several other proteins including pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPPA), angiotensinogen (AGT), and C3dg.

          PTK2: This gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase which is found concentrated in the focal adhesions that form between cells growing in the presence of extracellular matrix constituents. The encoded protein is a member of the FAK subfamily of protein tyrosine kinases but lacks significant sequence similarity to kinases from other subfamilies.

This gene is one in a cluster of serpin genes located on the q arm of chromosome 14. This family member is a glycoprotein that can inhibit several serine proteases, including protein C and various plasminogen activators and kallikreins, and it thus plays diverse roles in hemostasis and thrombosis in multiple organs.

[provided by RefSeq, Oct 2011]

          STC1: This gene encodes a secreted, homodimeric glycoprotein that is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and may have autocrine or paracrine functions. The gene contains a 5' UTR rich in CAG trinucleotide repeats. The encoded protein contains 11 conserved cysteine residues and is phosphorylated by protein kinase C exclusively on its serine residues. The protein may play a role in the regulation of renal and intestinal calcium and phosphate transport, cell metabolism, or cellular calcium/phosphate homeostasis. Overexpression of human stanniocalcin 1 in mice produces high serum phosphate levels, dwarfism, and increased metabolic rate. This gene has altered expression in hepatocellular, ovarian, and breast cancers. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          THBD: The protein encoded by this intronless gene is an endothelial-specific type I membrane receptor that binds thrombin. This binding results in the activation of protein C, which degrades clotting factors Va and VIIIa and reduces the amount of thrombin generated. Mutations in this gene are a cause of thromboembolic disease, also known as inherited thrombophilia. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          TIMP1: This gene belongs to the TIMP gene family. The proteins encoded by this gene family are natural inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a group of peptidases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix. In addition to its inhibitory role against most of the known MMPs, the encoded protein is able to promote cell proliferation in a wide range of cell types, and may also have an anti-apoptotic function. Transcription of this gene is highly inducible in response to many cytokines and hormones. In addition, the expression from some but not all inactive X chromosomes suggests that this gene inactivation is polymorphic in human females. This gene is located within intron 6 of the synapsin I gene and is transcribed in the opposite direction. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          TNFRSF21: This gene encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The encoded protein activates nuclear factor kappa-B and mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (also called c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1), and induces cell apoptosis. Through its death domain, the encoded receptor interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated death domain (TRADD) protein, which is known to mediate signal transduction of tumor necrosis factor receptors. Knockout studies in mice suggest that this gene plays a role in T-helper cell activation, and may be involved in inflammation and immune regulation. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]

          VAV2: VAV2 is the second member of the VAV guanine nucleotide exchange factor family of oncogenes. Unlike VAV1, which is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells, VAV2 transcripts were found in most tissues. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2008]

          VCAN: This gene is a member of the aggrecan/versican proteoglycan family. The protein encoded is a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan and is a major component of the extracellular matrix. This protein is involved in cell adhesion, proliferation, proliferation, migration and angiogenesis and plays a central role in tissue morphogenesis and maintenance. Mutations in this gene are the cause of Wagner syndrome type 1. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2009]

          VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome. Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is antiangiogenic. Expression of some isoforms derived from the AUG start codon is regulated by a small upstream open reading frame, which is located within an internal ribosome entry site. The levels of VEGF are increased during infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), thus promoting inflammation by facilitating recruitment of inflammatory cells, and by increasing the level of angiopoietin II (Ang II), one of two products of the SARS-CoV-2 binding target, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In turn, Ang II facilitates the elevation of VEGF, thus forming a vicious cycle in the release of inflammatory cytokines. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2020]

          VTN: The protein encoded by this gene functions in part as an adhesive glycoprotein. Differential expression of this protein can promote either cell adhesion or migration as it links cells to the extracellular matrix through a variety of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpin serine protease inhibitors. This protein can also promote extracellular matrix degradation and thus plays a role in tumorigenesis. It is involved in a variety of other biological processes such as the regulation of the coagulation pathway, wound healing, and tissue remodeling. The heparin-binding domain of this protein give it anti-microbial properties. It is also a lipid binding protein that forms a principal component of high density lipoprotein.

          Here are the gene summaries:


          APOH: Apolipoprotein H, also known as beta-2-glycoprotein I, is a component of circulating plasma lipoproteins. It has been implicated in a variety of physiologic pathways including lipoprotein metabolism, coagulation, hemostasis, and the production of antiphospholipid autoantibodies. APOH may be a required cofactor for anionic phospholipid binding by the antiphospholipid autoantibodies found in sera of many patients with lupus and primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The anti-beta (2) glycoprotein I antibodies from APS patients, mediate inhibition of activated protein C which has anticoagulant properties. Because beta-2-GPI is the main autoantigen in patients with APS, the disruption of this pathway by autoantibodies may be an important mechanism for thrombosis in patients with APS.[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2019]

          APP: This gene encodes a cell surface receptor and transmembrane precursor protein that is cleaved by secretases to form a number of peptides. Some of these peptides are secreted and can bind to the acetyltransferase complex APBB1/TIP60 to promote transcriptional activation, while others form the protein basis of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease. In addition, two of the peptides are antimicrobial peptides, having been shown to have bacteriocidal and antifungal activities. Mutations in this gene have been implicated in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease and cerebroarterial amyloidosis (cerebral amyloid angiopathy). Multiple transcript variants encoding several different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2014]

          COL3A1: This gene encodes the pro-alpha1 chains of type III collagen, a fibrillar collagen that is found in extensible connective tissues such as skin, lung, uterus, intestine and the vascular system, frequently in association with type I collagen. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, and with aortic and arterial aneurysms. [provided by R. Dalgleish, Feb 2008]

          COL5A2: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely related to type XI collagen and it is possible that the collagen chains of types V and XI constitute a single collagen type with tissue-specific chain combinations. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, types I and II. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          CXCL6: The protein encoded by this gene is a member CXC chemokine family. The encoded protein is a chemotactic for neutrophil granulocytes and has antibacterial action against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. This gene and other members of the CXC chemokine gene family form a gene cluster in a region of chromosome 4q. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2020]

          FGFR1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family, where amino acid sequence is highly conserved between members and throughout evolution. FGFR family members differ from one another in their ligand affinities and tissue distribution. A full-length representative protein consists of an extracellular region, composed of three immunoglobulin-like domains, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular portion of the protein interacts with fibroblast growth factors, setting in motion a cascade of downstream signals, ultimately influencing mitogenesis and differentiation. This particular family member binds both acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors and is involved in limb induction. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Pfeiffer syndrome, Jackson-Weiss syndrome, Antley-Bixler syndrome, osteoglophonic dysplasia, and autosomal dominant Kallmann syndrome 2. Chromosomal aberrations involving this gene are associated with stem cell myeloproliferative disorder and stem cell leukemia lymphoma syndrome. Alternatively spliced variants which encode different protein isoforms have been described; however, not all variants have been fully characterized. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          FSTL1: This gene encodes a protein with similarity to follistatin, an activin-binding protein. It contains an FS module, a follistatin-like sequence containing 10 conserved cysteine residues. This gene product is thought to be an autoantigen associated with rheumatoid arthritis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          ITGAV: The product of this gene belongs to the integrin alpha chain family. Integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha subunit and a beta subunit that function in cell surface adhesion and signaling. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate light and heavy chains that comprise the alpha V subunit. This subunit associates with beta 1, beta 3, beta 5, beta 6 and beta 8 subunits. The heterodimer consisting of alpha V and beta 3 subunits is also known as the vitronectin receptor. This integrin may regulate angiogenesis and cancer progression. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Note that the integrin alpha 5 and integrin alpha V subunits are encoded by distinct genes. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]

          JAG1: The jagged 1 protein encoded by JAG1 is the human homolog of the Drosophilia jagged protein. Human jagged 1 is the ligand for the receptor notch 1, the latter is involved in signaling processes. Mutations that alter the jagged 1 protein cause Alagille syndrome. Jagged 1 signalling through notch 1 has also been shown to play a role in hematopoiesis. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2019]

          JAG2: The Notch signaling pathway is an intercellular signaling mechanism that is essential for proper embryonic development. Members of the Notch gene family encode transmembrane receptors that are critical for various cell fate decisions. The protein encoded by this gene is one of several ligands that activate Notch and related receptors. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          KCNJ8: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins. Defects in this gene may be a cause of J-wave syndromes and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). [provided by RefSeq, May 2012]

          LPL: LPL encodes lipoprotein lipase, which is expressed in heart, muscle, and adipose tissue. LPL functions as a homodimer, and has the dual functions of triglyceride hydrolase and ligand/bridging factor for receptor-mediated lipoprotein uptake. Severe mutations that cause LPL deficiency result in type I hyperlipoproteinemia, while less extreme mutations in LPL are linked to many disorders of lipoprotein metabolism. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          LRPAP1: This gene encodes a protein that interacts with the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein and facilitates its proper folding and localization by preventing the binding of ligands. Mutations in this gene have been identified in individuals with myopia 23. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2013]

          LUM: This gene encodes a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family that includes decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, keratocan, epiphycan, and osteoglycin. In these bifunctional molecules, the protein moiety binds collagen fibrils and the highly charged hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans regulate interfibrillar spacings. Lumican is the major keratan sulfate proteoglycan of the cornea but is also distributed in interstitial collagenous matrices throughout the body. Lumican may regulate collagen fibril organization and circumferential growth, corneal transparency, and epithelial cell migration and tissue repair. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          MSX1: This gene encodes a member of the muscle segment homeobox gene family. The encoded protein functions as a transcriptional repressor during embryogenesis through interactions with components of the core transcription complex and other homeoproteins. It may also have roles in limb-pattern formation, craniofacial development, particularly odontogenesis, and tumor growth inhibition. Mutations in this gene, which was once known as homeobox 7, have been associated with nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate 5, Witkop syndrome, Wolf-Hirschom syndrome, and autosomoal dominant hypodontia. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          NRP1: This gene encodes one of two neuropilins, which contain specific protein domains which allow them to participate in several different types of signaling pathways that control cell migration. Neuropilins contain a large N-terminal extracellular domain, made up of complement-binding, coagulation factor V/VIII, and meprin domains. These proteins also contains a short membrane-spanning domain and a small cytoplasmic domain. Neuropilins bind many ligands and various types of co-receptors; they affect cell survival, migration, and attraction. Some of the ligands and co-receptors bound by neuropilins are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and semaphorin family members. This protein has also been determined to act as a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19) to infect host cells. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2020]

          OLR1: This gene encodes a low density lipoprotein receptor that belongs to the C-type lectin superfamily. This gene is regulated through the cyclic AMP signaling pathway. The encoded protein binds, internalizes and degrades oxidized low-density lipoprotein. This protein may be involved in the regulation of Fas-induced apoptosis. This protein may play a role as a scavenger receptor. Mutations of this gene have been associated with atherosclerosis, risk of myocardial infarction, and may modify the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Feb 2010]

          PDGFA: This gene encodes a member of the protein family comprised of both platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF). The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate platelet-derived growth factor subunit A, which can homodimerize, or alternatively, heterodimerize with the related platelet-derived growth factor subunit B. These proteins bind and activate PDGF receptor tyrosine kinases, which play a role in a wide range of developmental processes. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]

          PF4: This gene encodes a member of the CXC chemokine family. This chemokine is released from the alpha granules of activated platelets in the form of a homotetramer which has high affinity for heparin and is involved in platelet aggregation.

[provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

          POSTN: This gene encodes a secreted extracellular matrix protein that functions in tissue development and regeneration, including wound healing, and ventricular remodeling following myocardial infarction. The encoded protein binds to integrins to support adhesion and migration of epithelial cells. This protein plays a role in cancer stem cell maintenance and metastasis. Mice lacking this gene exhibit cardiac valve disease, and skeletal and dental defects. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.

A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is antiangiogenic. Expression of some isoforms derived from the AUG start codon is regulated by a small upstream open reading frame, which is located within an internal ribosome entry site. The levels of VEGF are increased during infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), thus promoting inflammation by facilitating recruitment of inflammatory cells, and by increasing the level of angiopoietin II (Ang II), one of two products of the SARS-CoV-2 binding target, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In turn, Ang II facilitates the elevation of VEGF, thus forming a vicious cycle in the release of inflammatory cytokines. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2020]

          VTN: The protein encoded by this gene functions in part as an adhesive glycoprotein. Differential expression of this protein can promote either cell adhesion or migration as it links cells to the extracellular matrix through a variety of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpin serine protease inhibitors. This protein can also promote extracellular matrix degradation and thus plays a role in tumorigenesis. It is involved in a variety of other biological processes such as the regulation of the coagulation pathway, wound healing, and tissue remodeling. The heparin-binding domain of this protein give it anti-microbial properties. It is also a lipid binding protein that forms a principal component of high density lipoprotein.

          STC1: This gene encodes a secreted, homodimeric glycoprotein that is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and may have autocrine or paracrine functions. The gene contains a 5' UTR rich in CAG trinucleotide repeats. The encoded protein contains 11 conserved cysteine residues and is phosphorylated by protein kinase C exclusively on its serine residues. The protein may play a role in the regulation of renal and intestinal calcium and phosphate transport, cell metabolism, or cellula...

          THBD: The protein encoded by this intronless gene is an endothelial-specific type I membrane receptor that binds thrombin. This binding results in the activation of protein C, which degrades clotting factors Va and VIIIa and reduces the amount of thrombin ...

          TIMP1: This gene belongs to the TIMP gene family. The proteins encoded by this gene family are natural inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a group of peptidases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix. In addition to its inhibitory role against most of the known MMPs, the encoded protein is able to promote cell proliferation in a wide range of cell types, and may also have an anti-apoptotic function. Transcription of this gene is highly inducible in response to many cytokines and ho...

          TNFRSF21: This gene encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The encoded protein activates nuclear factor kappa-B and mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (also called c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1), and induces cell apoptosis. Through its death domain, the encoded receptor interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated death domain (TRADD) protein, which is known to mediate sign...

          VAV2: VAV2 is the second member of the VAV guanine nucleotide exchange factor family of oncogenes. Unlike VAV1, which is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells, VAV2 transcripts were found in most tissues. Alternati...

          VCAN: This gene is a member of the aggrecan/versican proteoglycan family. The protein encoded is a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan and is a major component of the extracellular matrix. This protein is involved in cell adhesion, proliferation, proliferation, migration and angiogenesis and plays a central role in tissue morphogenesis and ma...

          VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome. Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is antiangiogenic. Expr...

          VTN: The protein encoded by this gene functions in part as an adhesive glycoprotein. Differential expression of this protein can promote either cell adhesion or migration as it links cells to the extracellular matrix through a variety of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpin serine protease inhibitors. This protein can also promote extracellular matrix degr...

Mutations in this gene, which was once known as homeobox 7, have been associated with nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate 5, Witkop syndrome, Wolf-Hirschom syndrome, and autosomoal dominant hypodontia. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          TNFRSF21: This gene encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The encoded protein activates nuclear factor kappa-B and mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (also called c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1), and induces cell apoptosis. Through its death domain, the encoded receptor interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated death domain (TRADD) protein, which is known to mediate signal transduction of tumor necrosis factor receptors. Knockout studies in mice suggest that this gene plays a role in T-helper cell activation, and may be involved in inflammation and immune regulation. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]

The gene contains a 5' UTR rich in CAG trinucleotide repeats. The encoded protein contains 11 conserved cysteine residues and is phosphorylated by protein kinase C exclusively on its serine residues. The protein may play a role in the regulation of renal and intestinal calcium and phosphate transport, cell metabolism, or cellular calcium/phosphate homeostasis. Overexpression of human stanniocalcin 1 in mice produces high serum phosphate levels, dwarfism, and increased metabolic rate.

[provided by RefSeq, Oct 2011]

          VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome. Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is antiangiogenic. Expression of some isoforms derived from the AUG start codon is regulated by a small upstream open reading frame, which is located within an internal ribosome entry site. The levels of VEGF are increased during infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), thus promoting inflammation by facilitating recruitment of inflammatory cells, and by increasing the level of angiopoietin II (Ang II), one of two products of the SARS-CoV-2 binding target, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In turn, Ang II facilitates the elevation of VEGF, thus forming a vicious cycle in the release of inflammatory cytokines. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2020]

The anti-beta (2) glycoprotein I antibodies from APS patients, mediate inhibition of activated protein C which has anticoagulant properties. Because beta-2-GPI is the main autoantigen in patients with APS, the disruption of this pathway by autoantibodies may be an important mechanism for thrombosis in patients with APS.[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2019]

          FGFR1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family, where amino acid sequence is highly conserved between members and throughout evolution.

LPL functions as a homodimer, and has the dual functions of triglyceride hydrolase and ligand/bridging factor for receptor-mediated lipoprotein uptake. Severe mutations that cause LPL deficiency result in type I hyperlipoproteinemia, while less extreme mutations in LPL are linked to many disorders of lipoprotein metabolism. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          NRP1: This gene encodes one of two neuropilins, which contain specific protein domains which allow them to participate in several different types of signaling pathways that control cell migration. Neuropilins contain a large N-terminal extracellular domain, made up of complement-binding, coagulation factor V/VIII, and meprin domains. These proteins also contains a short membrane-spanning domain and a small cytoplasmic domain. Neuropilins bind many ligands and various types of co-receptors; they affect cell survival, migration, and attraction. Some of the ligands and co-receptors bound by neuropilins are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and semaphorin family members. This protein has also been determined to act as a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19) to infect host cells. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2020]

          PRG2: The protein encoded by this gene is the predominant constituent of the crystalline core of the eosinophil granule. High levels of the proform of this protein are also present in placenta and pregnancy serum, where it exists as a complex with several other proteins including pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPPA), angiotensinogen (AGT), and C3dg. This protein may be involved in antiparasitic defense mechanisms as a cytotoxin and helminthotoxin, and in immune hypersensitivity reactions. The encoded protein contains a peptide that displays potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi.

The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins. Defects in this gene may be a cause of J-wave syndromes and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). [provided by RefSeq, May 2012]

          VTN: The protein encoded by this gene functions in part as an adhesive glycoprotein. Differential expression of this protein can promote either cell adhesion or migration as it links cells to the extracellular matrix through a variety of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpin serine protease inhibitors. This protein can also promote extracellular matrix degradation and thus plays a role in tumorigenesis. It is involved in a variety of other biological processes such as the regulation of the coagulation pathway, wound healing, and tissue remodeling. The heparin-binding domain of this protein give it anti-microbial properties. It is also a lipid binding protein that forms a principal component of high density lipoprotein.

The extracellular portion of the protein interacts with fibroblast growth factors, setting in motion a cascade of downstream signals, ultimately influencing mitogenesis and differentiation. This particular family member binds both acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors and is involved in limb induction. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Pfeiffer syndrome, Jackson-Weiss syndrome, Antley-Bixler syndrome, osteoglophonic dysplasia, and autosomal dominant Kallmann syndrome 2. Chromosomal aberrations involving this gene are associated with stem cell myeloproliferative disorder and stem cell leukemia lymphoma syndrome. Alternatively spliced variants which encode different protein isoforms have been described; however, not all variants have been fully characterized. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          PTK2: This gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase which is found concentrated in the focal adhesions that form between cells growing in the presence of extracellular matrix constituents. The encoded protein is a member of the FAK subfamily of protein tyrosine kinases but lacks significant sequence similarity to kinases from other subfamilies. Activation of this gene may be an important early step in cell growth and intracellular signal transduction pathways triggered in response to certain neural peptides or to cell interactions with the extracellular matrix. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2017]

          FSTL1: This gene encodes a protein with similarity to follistatin, an activin-binding protein. It contains an FS module, a follistatin-like sequence containing 10 conserved cysteine residues. This gene product is thought to be an autoantigen associated with rheumatoid arthritis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          SLCO2A1: This gene encodes a prostaglandin transporter that is a member of the 12-membrane-spanning superfamily of transporters. The encoded protein may be involved in mediating the uptake and clearance of prostaglandins in numerous tissues. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2011]

          COL3A1: This gene encodes the pro-alpha1 chains of type III collagen, a fibrillar collagen that is found in extensible connective tissues such as skin, lung, uterus, intestine and the vascular system, frequently in association with type I collagen. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, and with aortic and arterial aneurysms. [provided by R. Dalgleish, Feb 2008]

          THBD: The protein encoded by this intronless gene is an endothelial-specific type I membrane receptor that binds thrombin. This binding results in the activation of protein C, which degrades clotting factors Va and VIIIa and reduces the amount of thrombin generated. Mutations in this gene are a cause of thromboembolic disease, also known as inherited thrombophilia. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          LPL: LPL encodes lipoprotein lipase, which is expressed in heart, muscle, and adipose tissue. LPL functions as a homodimer, and has the dual functions of triglyceride hydrolase and ligand/bridging factor for receptor-mediated lipoprotein uptake. Severe mutations that cause LPL deficiency result in type I hyperlipoproteinemia, while less extreme mutations in LPL are linked to many disorders of lipoprotein metabolism. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          NRP1: This gene encodes one of two neuropilins, which contain specific protein domains which allow them to participate in several different types of signaling pathways that control cell migration. Neuropilins contain a large N-terminal extracellular domain, made up of complement-binding, coagulation factor V/VIII, and meprin domains. These proteins also contains a short membrane-spanning domain and a small cytoplasmic domain. Neuropilins bind many ligands and various types of co-receptors; they affect cell survival, migration, and attraction. Some of the ligands and co-receptors bound by neuropilins are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and semaphorin family members. This protein has also been determined to act as a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19) to infect host cells. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2020]

          PRG2: The protein encoded by this gene is the predominant constituent of the crystalline core of the eosinophil granule. High levels of the proform of this protein are also present in placenta and pregnancy serum, where it exists as a complex with several other proteins including pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPPA), angiotensinogen (AGT), and C3dg. This protein may be involved in antiparasitic defense mechanisms as a cytotoxin and helminthotoxin, and in immune hypersensitivity reactions. The encoded protein contains a peptide that displays potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. It is directly implicated in epithelial cell damage, exfoliation, and bronchospasm in allergic diseases. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]

          COL5A2: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely related to type XI collagen and it is possible that the collagen chains of types V and XI constitute a single collagen type with tissue-specific chain combinations. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, types I and II. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          PDGFA: This gene encodes a member of the protein family comprised of both platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF). The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate platelet-derived growth factor subunit A, which can homodimerize, or alternatively, heterodimerize with the related platelet-derived growth factor subunit B. These proteins bind and activate PDGF receptor tyrosine kinases, which play a role in a wide range of developmental processes. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]

          JAG2: The Notch signaling pathway is an intercellular signaling mechanism that is essential for proper embryonic development. Members of the Notch gene family encode transmembrane receptors that are critical for various cell fate decisions. The protein encoded by this gene is one of several ligands that activate Notch and related receptors. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          SERPINA5: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the serpin family of proteins, a group of proteins that inhibit serine proteases. This gene is one in a cluster of serpin genes located on the q arm of chromosome 14. This family member is a glycoprotein that can inhibit several serine proteases, including protein C and various plasminogen activators and kallikreins, and it thus plays diverse roles in hemostasis and thrombosis in multiple organs. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2012]

          KCNJ8: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins. Defects in this gene may be a cause of J-wave syndromes and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). [provided by RefSeq, May 2012]

          VTN: The protein encoded by this gene functions in part as an adhesive glycoprotein. Differential expression of this protein can promote either cell adhesion or migration as it links cells to the extracellular matrix through a variety of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpin serine protease inhibitors. This protein can also promote extracellular matrix degradation and thus plays a role in tumorigenesis. It is involved in a variety of other biological processes such as the regulation of the coagulation pathway, wound healing, and tissue remodeling. The heparin-binding domain of this protein give it anti-microbial properties. It is also a lipid binding protein that forms a principal component of high density lipoprotein. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2020]

          LUM: This gene encodes a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family that includes decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, keratocan, epiphycan, and osteoglycin. In these bifunctional molecules, the protein moiety binds collagen fibrils and the highly charged hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans regulate interfibrillar spacings. Lumican is the major keratan sulfate proteoglycan of the cornea but is also distributed in interstitial collagenous matrices throughout the body. Lumican may regulate collagen fibril organization and circumferential growth, corneal transparency, and epithelial cell migration and tissue repair. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          VCAN: This gene is a member of the aggrecan/versican proteoglycan family. The protein encoded is a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan and is a major component of the extracellular matrix. This protein is involved in cell adhesion, proliferation, proliferation, migration and angiogenesis and plays a central role in tissue morphogenesis and maintenance. Mutations in this gene are the cause of Wagner syndrome type 1. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2009]
