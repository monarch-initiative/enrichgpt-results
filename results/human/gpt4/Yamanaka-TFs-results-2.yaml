          Here are the gene summaries:


          POU5F1: This gene encodes a transcription factor containing a POU homeodomain that plays a key role in embryonic development and stem cell pluripotency. Aberrant expression of this gene in adult tissues is associated with tumorigenesis. This gene can participate in a translocation with the Ewing's sarcoma gene on chromosome 21, which also leads to tumor formation. Alternative splicing, as well as usage of alternative AUG and non-AUG translation initiation codons, results in multiple isoforms. One of the AUG start codons is polymorphic in human populations. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 1, 3, 8, 10, and 12. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2013]

          SOX2: This intronless gene encodes a member of the SRY-related HMG-box (SOX) family of transcription factors involved in the regulation of embryonic development and in the determination of cell fate. The product of this gene is required for stem-cell maintenance in the central nervous system, and also regulates gene expression in the stomach. Mutations in this gene have been associated with optic nerve hypoplasia and with syndromic microphthalmia, a severe form of structural eye malformation. This gene lies within an intron of another gene called SOX2 overlapping transcript (SOX2OT). [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          KLF4: This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the Kruppel family of transcription factors. The encoded zinc finger protein is required for normal development of the barrier function of skin. The encoded protein is thought to control the G1-to-S transition of the cell cycle following DNA damage by mediating the tumor suppressor gene p53. Mice lacking this gene have a normal appearance but lose weight rapidly, and die shortly after birth due to fluid evaporation resulting from compromised epidermal barrier function. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]

          MYC: This gene is a proto-oncogene and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role in cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cellular transformation. The encoded protein forms a heterodimer with the related transcription factor MAX. This complex binds to the E box DNA consensus sequence and regulates the transcription of specific target genes. Amplification of this gene is frequently observed in numerous human cancers. Translocations involving this gene are associated with Burkitt lymphoma and multiple myeloma in human patients. There is evidence to show that translation initiates both from an upstream, in-frame non-AUG (CUG) and a downstream AUG start site, resulting in the production of two isoforms with distinct N-termini.

          Here are the gene summaries:


          POU5F1: This gene encodes a transcription factor containing a POU homeodomain that plays a key role in embryonic development and stem cell pluripotency. Aberrant expression of this gene in adult tissues is associated with tumorigenesis. This gene can participate in a translocation with the Ewing's sarcoma gene on chromosome 21, which also leads to tumor formation. Alternative splicing, as well as usage of alternative AUG and non-AUG translation initiation codons, results in multiple isoforms. One of the AUG start codons is polymorphic in human populations. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 1, 3, 8, 10, and 12. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2013]

          SOX2: This intronless gene encodes a member of the SRY-related HMG-box (SOX) family of transcription factors involved in the regulation of embryonic development and in the determination of cell fate. The product of this gene is required for stem-cell maintenance in the central nervous system, and also regulates gene expression in the stomach. Mutations in this gene have been associated with optic nerve hypoplasia and with syndromic microphthalmia, a severe form of structural eye malformation. This gene lies within an intron of another gene called SOX2 overlapping transcript (SOX2OT). [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          KLF4: This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the Kruppel family of transcription factors. The encoded zinc finger protein is required for normal development of the barrier function of skin. The encoded protein is thought to control the G1-to-S transition of the cell cycle following DNA damage by mediating the tumor suppressor gene p53. Mice lacking this gene have a normal appearance but lose weight rapidly, and die shortly after birth due to fluid evaporation resulting from compromised epidermal barrier function. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]

          MYC: This gene is a proto-oncogene and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role in cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cellular transformation. The encoded protein forms a heterodimer with the related transcription factor MAX. This complex binds to the E box DNA consensus sequence and regulates the transcription of specific target genes. Amplification of this gene is frequently observed in numerous human cancers. Translocations involving this gene are associated with Burkitt lymphoma and multiple myeloma in human patients. There is evidence to show that translation initiates both from an upstream, in-frame non-AUG (CUG) and a downstream AUG start site, resulting in the production of two isoforms with distinct N-termini.

Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]

          MYC: This gene is a proto-oncogene and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role in cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cellular transformation. The encoded protein forms a heterodimer with the related transcription factor MAX. This complex binds to the E box DNA consensus sequence and regulates the transcription of specific target genes. Amplification of this gene is frequently observed in numerous human cancers. Translocations involving this gene are associated with Burkitt lymphoma and multiple myeloma in human patients. There is evidence to show that translation initiates both from an upstream, in-frame non-AUG (CUG) and a downstream AUG start site, resulting in the production of two isoforms with distinct N-termini.

          Here are the gene summaries:


          POU5F1: This gene encodes a transcription factor containing a POU homeodomain that plays a key role in embryonic development and stem cell pluripotency. Aberrant expression of this gene in adult tissues is associated with tumorigenesis. This gene can participate in a translocation with the Ewing's sarcoma gene on chromosome 21, which also leads to tumor formation. Alternative splicing, as well as usage of alternative AUG and non-AUG translation initiation codons, results in multiple isoforms. One of the AUG start codons is polymorphic in human populations. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 1, 3, 8, 10, and 12. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2013]

          SOX2: This intronless gene encodes a member of the SRY-related HMG-box (SOX) family of transcription factors involved in the regulation of embryonic development and in the determination of cell fate. The product of this gene is required for stem-cell maintenance in the central nervous system, and also regulates gene expression in the stomach. Mutations in this gene have been associated with optic nerve hypoplasia and with syndromic microphthalmia, a severe form of structural eye malformation. This gene lies within an intron of another gene called SOX2 overlapping transcript (SOX2OT). [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          KLF4: This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the Kruppel family of transcription factors. The encoded zinc finger protein is required for normal development of the barrier function of skin. The encoded protein is thought to control the G1-to-S transition of the cell cycle following DNA damage by mediating the tumor suppressor gene p53. Mice lacking this gene have a normal appearance but lose weight rapidly, and die shortly after birth due to fluid evaporation resulting from compromised epidermal barrier function. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]

          MYC: This gene is a proto-oncogene and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role in cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cellular transformation. The encoded protein forms a heterodimer with the related transcription factor MAX. This complex binds to the E box DNA consensus sequence and regulates the transcription of specific target genes. Amplification of this gene is frequently observed in numerous human cancers. Translocations involving this gene are associated with Burkitt lymphoma and multiple myeloma in human patients. There is evidence to show that translation initiates both from an upstream, in-frame non-AUG (CUG) and a downstream AUG start site, resulting in the production of two isoforms with distinct N-termini.

          I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of their functions.
          Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.
          i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.
          Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.
          Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.
          e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger morphogenesis"
          then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1 and gene2.
          Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
          Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

          Here are the gene summaries:


          POU5F1: This gene encodes a transcription factor containing a POU homeodomain that plays a key role in embryonic development and stem cell pluripotency. Aberrant expression of this gene in adult tissues is associated with tumorigenesis. This gene can participate in a translocation with the Ewing's sarcoma gene on chromosome 21, which also leads to tumor formation. Alternative splicing, as well as usage of alternative AUG and non-AUG translation initiation codons, results in multiple isoforms. One of the AUG start codons is polymorphic in human populations. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 1, 3, 8, 10, and 12. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2013]

          SOX2: This intronless gene encodes a member of the SRY-related HMG-box (SOX) family of transcription factors involved in the regulation of embryonic development and in the determination of cell fate. The product of this gene is required for stem-cell maintenance in the central nervous system, and also regulates gene expression in the stomach. Mutations in this gene have been associated with optic nerve hypoplasia and with syndromic microphthalmia, a severe form of structural eye malformation. This gene lies within an intron of another gene called SOX2 overlapping transcript (SOX2OT). [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

          KLF4: This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the Kruppel family of transcription factors. The encoded zinc finger protein is required for normal development of the barrier function of skin. The encoded protein is thought to control the G1-to-S transition of the cell cycle following DNA damage by mediating the tumor suppressor gene p53. Mice lacking this gene have a normal appearance but lose weight rapidly, and die shortly after birth due to fluid evaporation resulting from compromised epidermal barrier function. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]

          MYC: This gene is a proto-oncogene and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role in cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cellular transformation. The encoded protein forms a heterodimer with the related transcription factor MAX. This complex binds to the E box DNA consensus sequence and regulates the transcription of specific target genes. Amplification of this gene is frequently observed in numerous human cancers. Translocations involving this gene are associated with Burkitt lymphoma and multiple myeloma in human patients. There is evidence to show that translation initiates both from an upstream, in-frame non-AUG (CUG) and a downstream AUG start site, resulting in the production of two isoforms with distinct N-termini.

          Here are the gene summaries:


          MYC: This gene is a proto-oncogene and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role in cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cellular transformation. The encoded protein forms a heterodimer with the related transcription factor MAX. This complex binds to the E box DNA consensus sequence and regulates the transcription of specific target genes. Amplification of this gene is frequently observed in numerous human cancers. Translocations involving this gene are associated with Burkitt lymphoma and multiple myeloma in human patients. There is evidence to show that translation initiates both from an upstream, in-frame non-AUG (CUG) and a downstream AUG start site, resulting in the production of two isoforms with distinct N-termini. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]

          POU5F1: This gene encodes a transcription factor containing a POU homeodomain that plays a key role in embryonic development and stem cell pluripotency. Aberrant expression of this gene in adult tissues is associated with tumorigenesis. This gene can participate in a translocation with the Ewing's sarcoma gene on chromosome 21, which also leads to tumor formation. Alternative splicing, as well as usage of alternative AUG and non-AUG translation initiation codons, results in multiple isoforms. One of the AUG start codons is polymorphic in human populations. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 1, 3, 8, 10, and 12. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2013]

          KLF4: This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the Kruppel family of transcription factors. The encoded zinc finger protein is required for normal development of the barrier function of skin. The encoded protein is thought to control the G1-to-S transition of the cell cycle following DNA damage by mediating the tumor suppressor gene p53. Mice lacking this gene have a normal appearance but lose weight rapidly, and die shortly after birth due to fluid evaporation resulting from compromised epidermal barrier function. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]

          Here are the gene summaries:


          MYC: This gene is a proto-oncogene and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role in cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cellular transformation. The encoded protein forms a heterodimer with the related transcription factor MAX. This complex binds to the E box DNA consensus sequence and regulates the transcription of specific target genes. Amplification of this gene is frequently observed in numerous human cancers. Translocations involving this gene are associated with Burkitt lymphoma and multiple myeloma in human patients. There is evidence to show that translation initiates both from an upstream, in-frame non-AUG (CUG) and a downstream AUG start site, resulting in the production of two isoforms with distinct N-termini. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]

          POU5F1: This gene encodes a transcription factor containing a POU homeodomain that plays a key role in embryonic development and stem cell pluripotency. Aberrant expression of this gene in adult tissues is associated with tumorigenesis. This gene can participate in a translocation with the Ewing's sarcoma gene on chromosome 21, which also leads to tumor formation. Alternative splicing, as well as usage of alternative AUG and non-AUG translation initiation codons, results in multiple isoforms. One of the AUG start codons is polymorphic in human populations. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 1, 3, 8, 10, and 12. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2013]

          KLF4: This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the Kruppel family of transcription factors. The encoded zinc finger protein is required for normal development of the barrier function of skin. The encoded protein is thought to control the G1-to-S transition of the cell cycle following DNA damage by mediating the tumor suppressor gene p53. Mice lacking this gene have a normal appearance but lose weight rapidly, and die shortly after birth due to fluid evaporation resulting from compromised epidermal barrier function. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]

          Here are the gene summaries:


          MYC: This gene is a proto-oncogene and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role in cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cellular transformation. The encoded protein forms a heterodimer with the related transcription factor MAX. This complex binds to the E box DNA consensus sequence and regulates the transcription of specific target genes. Amplification of this gene is frequently observed in numerous human cancers. Translocations involving this gene are associated with Burkitt lymphoma and multiple myeloma in human patients. There is evidence to show that translation initiates both from an upstream, in-frame non-AUG (CUG) and a downstream AUG start site, resulting in the production of two isoforms with distinct N-termini. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]

          POU5F1: This gene encodes a transcription factor containing a POU homeodomain that plays a key role in embryonic development and stem cell pluripotency. Aberrant expression of this gene in adult tissues is associated with tumorigenesis. This gene can participate in a translocation with the Ewing's sarcoma gene on chromosome 21, which also leads to tumor formation. Alternative splicing, as well as usage of alternative AUG and non-AUG translation initiation codons, results in multiple isoforms. One of the AUG start codons is polymorphic in human populations. Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 1, 3, 8, 10, and 12. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2013]

          KLF4: This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the Kruppel family of transcription factors. The encoded zinc finger protein is required for normal development of the barrier function of skin. The encoded protein is thought to control the G1-to-S transition of the cell cycle following DNA damage by mediating the tumor suppressor gene p53. Mice lacking this gene have a normal appearance but lose weight rapidly, and die shortly after birth due to fluid evaporation resulting from compromised epidermal barrier function. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]
