      response_text: 'Summary: Muscle contraction and development

        Enriched Terms: muscle filament sliding; sarcomere organization; muscle system
        process


        Mechanism: The majority of the listed genes are involved in muscle contraction
        and development, specifically in the organization and structure of the sarcomere.
        The enriched terms - muscle filament sliding, sarcomere organization, and
        muscle system process - all relate to the mechanisms of muscle contraction
        and the intricate process of sarcomere formation.


        Hypothesis: The significant enrichment of genes involved in muscle contraction
        and sarcomere development suggests that there may be shared pathways and mechanisms
        governing these processes. One potential pathway may involve the regulation
        of actin and myosin filaments, which are crucial components of the sarcomere
        and fundamental to muscle contraction. Another potential pathway may involve
        the coordination of signaling cascades that promote muscle growth and differentiation.
        Further research in these areas could lead to a better understanding of muscle
        function and the treatment of muscle-related diseases.'

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Hypothesis: These genes are mainly involved in muscle structure and function.
        They function in muscle contraction and maintenance through various mechanisms,
        including regulation of muscle filaments, myosin activity, and actin dynamics.
        The statistically over-represented terms are related to muscle structure and

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

      response_text: '

        Organism metabolic pathways and protein regulation are enhanced in this group
        of genes. This enhancement includes increased ion channeling, cellular transport
        processes, lipid metabolism, and gene regulation. The pathways involve small
        and large molecules, as well as neurotransmitter signaling.


        Mechanism: This group of genes works together to regulate metabolic processes
        in the organism, working at a cellular level that includes ions, lipids, proteins,
        and other molecules. The genes also interact to create networks of ion channels
        and transporter proteins that allow for efficient nutrient delivery, active
        metabolic pathways, and the regulation of gene expression.

      summary: '

        Organism metabolic pathways and protein regulation are enhanced in this group
        of genes. This enhancement includes increased ion channeling, cellular transport
        processes, lipid metabolism, and gene regulation. The pathways involve small
        and large molecules, as well as neurotransmitter signaling.


        Mechanism: This group of genes works together to regulate metabolic processes
        in the organism, working at a cellular level that includes ions, lipids, proteins,
        and other molecules. The genes also interact to create networks of ion channels
        and transporter proteins that allow for efficient nutrient delivery, active
        metabolic pathways, and the regulation of gene expression.

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.
