        Here are the gene summaries:



        DRD1: This gene encodes the D1 subtype of the dopamine receptor. The D1 subtype
        is the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system. This
        G-protein coupled receptor stimulates adenylyl cyclase and activates cyclic
        AMP-dependent protein kinases. D1 receptors regulate neuronal growth and development,
        mediate some behavioral responses, and modulate dopamine receptor D2-mediated
        events. Alternate transcription initiation sites result in two transcript
        variants of this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PTGER1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the G protein-coupled
        receptor family. This protein is one of four receptors identified for prostaglandin
        E2 (PGE2). Through a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system,
        G-Q proteins mediate this receptor''s activity. Knockout studies in mice suggested
        a role of this receptor in mediating algesia and in regulation of blood pressure.
        Studies in mice also suggested that this gene may mediate adrenocorticotropic
        hormone response to bacterial endotoxin. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        SLC1A1: This gene encodes a member of the high-affinity glutamate transporters
        that play an essential role in transporting glutamate across plasma membranes.
        In brain, these transporters are crucial in terminating the postsynaptic action
        of the neurotransmitter glutamate, and in maintaining extracellular glutamate
        concentrations below neurotoxic levels. This transporter also transports aspartate,
        and mutations in this gene are thought to cause dicarboxylicamino aciduria,
        also known as glutamate-aspartate transport defect. [provided by RefSeq, Mar
        2010]


        ADCY6: This gene encodes a member of the adenylyl cyclase family of proteins,
        which are required for the synthesis of cyclic AMP. All members of this family
        have an intracellular N-terminus, a tandem repeat of six transmembrane domains
        separated by a cytoplasmic loop, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The
        two cytoplasmic regions bind ATP and form the catalytic core of the protein.
        Adenylyl cyclases are important effectors of transmembrane signaling pathways
        and are regulated by the activity of G protein coupled receptor signaling.
        This protein belongs to a small subclass of adenylyl cyclase proteins that
        are functionally related and are inhibited by protein kinase A, calcium ions
        and nitric oxide. A mutation in this gene is associated with arthrogryposis
        multiplex congenita. [provided by RefSeq, May 2015]


        NSG1: Predicted to enable clathrin light chain binding activity. Involved
        in apoptotic process. Located in endoplasmic reticulum. [provided by Alliance
        of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        GNA15: Enables G protein-coupled receptor binding activity. Involved in positive
        regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration involved in phospholipase
        C-activating G protein-coupled signaling pathway. Predicted to be located
        in plasma membrane. Predicted to be part of heterotrimeric G-protein complex.
        [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        FLNA: The protein encoded by this gene is an actin-binding protein that crosslinks
        actin filaments and links actin filaments to membrane glycoproteins. The encoded
        protein is involved in remodeling the cytoskeleton to effect changes in cell
        shape and migration. This protein interacts with integrins, transmembrane
        receptor complexes, and second messengers. Defects in this gene are a cause
        of several syndromes, including periventricular nodular heterotopias (PVNH1,
        PVNH4), otopalatodigital syndromes (OPD1, OPD2), frontometaphyseal dysplasia
        (FMD), Melnick-Needles syndrome (MNS), and X-linked congenital idiopathic
        intestinal pseudoobstruction (CIIPX). Two transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2009]


        GNAS: This locus has a highly complex imprinted expression pattern. It gives
        rise to maternally, paternally, and biallelically expressed transcripts that
        are derived from four alternative promoters and 5'' exons. Some transcripts
        contain a differentially methylated region (DMR) at their 5'' exons, and this
        DMR is commonly found in imprinted genes and correlates with transcript expression.
        An antisense transcript is produced from an overlapping locus on the opposite
        strand. One of the transcripts produced from this locus, and the antisense
        transcript, are paternally expressed noncoding RNAs, and may regulate imprinting
        in this region. In addition, one of the transcripts contains a second overlapping
        ORF, which encodes a structurally unrelated protein - Alex. Alternative splicing
        of downstream exons is also observed, which results in different forms of
        the stimulatory G-protein alpha subunit, a key element of the classical signal
        transduction pathway linking receptor-ligand interactions with the activation
        of adenylyl cyclase and a variety of cellular reponses. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Mutations
        in this gene result in pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a, pseudohypoparathyroidism
        type 1b, Albright hereditary osteodystrophy, pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism,
        McCune-Albright syndrome, progressive osseus heteroplasia, polyostotic fibrous
        dysplasia of bone, and some pituitary tumors. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2012]


        DRD3: This gene encodes the D3 subtype of the five (D1-D5) dopamine receptors.
        The activity of the D3 subtype receptor is mediated by G proteins which inhibit
        adenylyl cyclase. This receptor is localized to the limbic areas of the brain,
        which are associated with cognitive, emotional, and endocrine functions. Genetic
        variation in this gene may be associated with susceptibility to hereditary
        essential tremor 1. Alternative splicing of this gene results in transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms, although some variants may be subject
        to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        GNAI3: Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as modulators
        or transducers in various transmembrane signaling pathways. G proteins are
        composed of 3 units: alpha, beta and gamma. This gene encodes an alpha subunit
        and belongs to the G-alpha family. Mutation in this gene, resulting in a gly40-to-arg
        substitution, is associated with auriculocondylar syndrome, and shown to affect
        downstream targets in the G protein-coupled endothelin receptor pathway. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jun 2012]


        GNAO1: The protein encoded by this gene represents the alpha subunit of the
        Go heterotrimeric G-protein signal-transducing complex. Defects in this gene
        are a cause of early-onset epileptic encephalopathy. Two transcript variants
        encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq,
        Aug 2015]


        GNB1: Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), which
        integrate signals between receptors and effector proteins, are composed of
        an alpha, a beta, and a gamma subunit. These subunits are encoded by families
        of related genes. This gene encodes a beta subunit. Beta subunits are important
        regulators of alpha subunits, as well as of certain signal transduction receptors
        and effectors. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
        [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]


        GSK3B: The protein encoded by this gene is a serine-threonine kinase belonging
        to the glycogen synthase kinase subfamily. It is a negative regulator of glucose
        homeostasis and is involved in energy metabolism, inflammation, ER-stress,
        mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptotic pathways. Defects in this gene have
        been associated with Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease. [provided by
        RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        GNAQ: This locus encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein. The encoded
        protein, an alpha subunit in the Gq class, couples a seven-transmembrane domain
        receptor to activation of phospolipase C-beta. Mutations at this locus have
        been associated with problems in platelet activation and aggregation. A related

        in agonist-mediated desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors and cause
        specific dampening of cellular responses to stimuli such as hormones, neurotransmitters,
        or sensory signals. Arrestin beta 2, like arrestin beta 1, was shown to inhibit
        beta-adrenergic receptor function in vitro. It is expressed at high levels
        in the central nervous system and may play a role in the regulation of synaptic
        receptors. Besides the brain, a cDNA for arrestin beta 2 was isolated from
        thyroid gland, and thus it may also be involved in hormone-specific desensitization
        of TSH receptors. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding

        more specifically the alpha q subfamily of G proteins. The encoded protein

        Adenylyl cyclases mediate G protein-coupled receptor signaling through the
        synthesis of the second messenger cAMP. Activity of the encoded protein is
        stimulated by the Gs alpha subunit of G protein-coupled receptors and is inhibited
        by protein kinase A, calcium and Gi alpha subunits. Single nucleotide polymorphisms

        with schizophrenia. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms. A third variant has been described,
        but it has not been determined whether this form is normal or due to aberrant
        splicing. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        NCSTN: This gene encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is an integral
        component of the multimeric gamma-secretase complex. The encoded protein cleaves
        integral membrane proteins, including Notch receptors and beta-amyloid precursor
        protein, and may be a stabilizing cofactor required for gamma-secretase complex
        assembly. The cleavage of beta-amyloid precursor protein yields amyloid beta
        peptide, the main component of the neuritic plaque and the hallmark lesion
        in the brains of patients with Alzheimer''s disease; however, the nature of
        the encoded protein''s role in Alzheimer''s disease is not known for certain.
        Mutations in this gene are associated with familial acne inversa. A pseudogene

        Here are the gene summaries:



        DRD1: This gene encodes the D1 subtype of the dopamine receptor. The D1 subtype
        is the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system. This
        G-protein coupled receptor stimulates adenylyl cyclase and activates cyclic
        AMP-dependent protein kinases. D1 receptors regulate neuronal growth and development,
        mediate some behavioral responses, and modulate dopamine receptor D2-mediated
        events. Alternate transcription initiation sites result in two transcript
        variants of this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PTGER1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the G protein-coupled
        receptor family. This protein is one of four receptors identified for prostaglandin
        E2 (PGE2). Through a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system,
        G-Q proteins mediate this receptor''s activity. Knockout studies in mice suggested
        a role of this receptor in mediating algesia and in regulation of blood pressure.
        Studies in mice also suggested that this gene may mediate adrenocorticotropic
        hormone response to bacterial endotoxin. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        SLC1A1: This gene encodes a member of the high-affinity glutamate transporters
        that play an essential role in transporting glutamate across plasma membranes.
        In brain, these transporters are crucial in terminating the postsynaptic action
        of the neurotransmitter glutamate, and in maintaining extracellular glutamate
        concentrations below neurotoxic levels. This transporter also transports aspartate,
        and mutations in this gene are thought to cause dicarboxylicamino aciduria,
        also known as glutamate-aspartate transport defect. [provided by RefSeq, Mar
        2010]


        ADCY6: This gene encodes a member of the adenylyl cyclase family of proteins,
        which are required for the synthesis of cyclic AMP. All members of this family
        have an intracellular N-terminus, a tandem repeat of six transmembrane domains
        separated by a cytoplasmic loop, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The
        two cytoplasmic regions bind ATP and form the catalytic core of the protein.
        Adenylyl cyclases are important effectors of transmembrane signaling pathways
        and are regulated by the activity of G protein coupled receptor signaling.
        This protein belongs to a small subclass of adenylyl cyclase proteins that
        are functionally related and are inhibited by protein kinase A, calcium ions
        and nitric oxide. A mutation in this gene is associated with arthrogryposis
        multiplex congenita. [provided by RefSeq, May 2015]


        NSG1: Predicted to enable clathrin light chain binding activity. Involved
        in apoptotic process. Located in endoplasmic reticulum. [provided by Alliance
        of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        GNA15: Enables G protein-coupled receptor binding activity. Involved in positive
        regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration involved in phospholipase
        C-activating G protein-coupled signaling pathway. Predicted to be located
        in plasma membrane. Predicted to be part of heterotrimeric G-protein complex.
        [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        FLNA: The protein encoded by this gene is an actin-binding protein that crosslinks
        actin filaments and links actin filaments to membrane glycoproteins. The encoded
        protein is involved in remodeling the cytoskeleton to effect changes in cell
        shape and migration. This protein interacts with integrins, transmembrane
        receptor complexes, and second messengers. Defects in this gene are a cause
        of several syndromes, including periventricular nodular heterotopias (PVNH1,
        PVNH4), otopalatodigital syndromes (OPD1, OPD2), frontometaphyseal dysplasia
        (FMD), Melnick-Needles syndrome (MNS), and X-linked congenital idiopathic
        intestinal pseudoobstruction (CIIPX). Two transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2009]


        GNAS: This locus has a highly complex imprinted expression pattern. It gives
        rise to maternally, paternally, and biallelically expressed transcripts that
        are derived from four alternative promoters and 5'' exons. Some transcripts
        contain a differentially methylated region (DMR) at their 5'' exons, and this
        DMR is commonly found in imprinted genes and correlates with transcript expression.
        An antisense transcript is produced from an overlapping locus on the opposite
        strand. One of the transcripts produced from this locus, and the antisense
        transcript, are paternally expressed noncoding RNAs, and may regulate imprinting
        in this region. In addition, one of the transcripts contains a second overlapping
        ORF, which encodes a structurally unrelated protein - Alex. Alternative splicing
        of downstream exons is also observed, which results in different forms of
        the stimulatory G-protein alpha subunit, a key element of the classical signal
        transduction pathway linking receptor-ligand interactions with the activation
        of adenylyl cyclase and a variety of cellular reponses. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Mutations
        in this gene result in pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a, pseudohypoparathyroidism
        type 1b, Albright hereditary osteodystrophy, pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism,
        McCune-Albright syndrome, progressive osseus heteroplasia, polyostotic fibrous
        dysplasia of bone, and some pituitary tumors. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2012]


        DRD3: This gene encodes the D3 subtype of the five (D1-D5) dopamine receptors.
        The activity of the D3 subtype receptor is mediated by G proteins which inhibit
        adenylyl cyclase. This receptor is localized to the limbic areas of the brain,
        which are associated with cognitive, emotional, and endocrine functions. Genetic
        variation in this gene may be associated with susceptibility to hereditary
        essential tremor 1. Alternative splicing of this gene results in transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms, although some variants may be subject
        to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        to be involved in clathrin coat assembly and endosomal transport. Located

        KLF16: Enables sequence-specific double-stranded DNA binding activity. Predicted
        to be involved in regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. Predicted
        to act upstream of or within dopamine receptor signaling pathway. Predicted
        to be located in nucleus. Predicted to be part of chromatin. [provided by
        Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]

        or transducers in various transmembrane signaling pathways. G proteins are
        composed of 3 units: alpha, beta and gamma. This gene encodes an alpha subunit
        and belongs to the G-alpha family. Mutation in this gene, resulting in a gly40-to-arg
        substitution, is associated with auriculocondylar syndrome, and shown to affect
        downstream targets in the G protein-coupled endothelin receptor pathway. [provided

        It is required for maximal stimulated calcium release after stimulation of
        purinergic or muscarinic but not beta-adrenergic receptors. The encoded protein
        interacts with D1 dopamine receptor and may interact with other DA receptor
        subtypes and/or GPCRs. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        GNG2: This gene encodes one of the gamma subunits of a guanine nucleotide-binding
        protein. Such proteins are involved in signaling mechanisms across membranes.
        Various subunits forms heterodimers which then interact with the different
        signal molecules. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        DRD1: This gene encodes the D1 subtype of the dopamine receptor. The D1 subtype
        is the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system. This
        G-protein coupled receptor stimulates adenylyl cyclase and activates cyclic
        AMP-dependent protein kinases. D1 receptors regulate neuronal growth and development,
        mediate some behavioral responses, and modulate dopamine receptor D2-mediated
        events. Alternate transcription initiation sites result in two transcript
        variants of this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PTGER1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the G protein-coupled
        receptor family. This protein is one of four receptors identified for prostaglandin
        E2 (PGE2). Through a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system,
        G-Q proteins mediate this receptor''s activity. Knockout studies in mice suggested
        a role of this receptor in mediating algesia and in regulation of blood pressure.
        Studies in mice also suggested that this gene may mediate adrenocorticotropic
        hormone response to bacterial endotoxin. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        SLC1A1: This gene encodes a member of the high-affinity glutamate transporters
        that play an essential role in transporting glutamate across plasma membranes.
        In brain, these transporters are crucial in terminating the postsynaptic action
        of the neurotransmitter glutamate, and in maintaining extracellular glutamate
        concentrations below neurotoxic levels. This transporter also transports aspartate,
        and mutations in this gene are thought to cause dicarboxylicamino aciduria,
        also known as glutamate-aspartate transport defect. [provided by RefSeq, Mar
        2010]


        ADCY6: This gene encodes a member of the adenylyl cyclase family of proteins,
        which are required for the synthesis of cyclic AMP. All members of this family
        have an intracellular N-terminus, a tandem repeat of six transmembrane domains
        separated by a cytoplasmic loop, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The
        two cytoplasmic regions bind ATP and form the catalytic core of the protein.
        Adenylyl cyclases are important effectors of transmembrane signaling pathways
        and are regulated by the activity of G protein coupled receptor signaling.
        This protein belongs to a small subclass of adenylyl cyclase proteins that
        are functionally related and are inhibited by protein kinase A, calcium ions
        and nitric oxide. A mutation in this gene is associated with arthrogryposis
        multiplex congenita. [provided by RefSeq, May 2015]


        NSG1: Predicted to enable clathrin light chain binding activity. Involved
        in apoptotic process. Located in endoplasmic reticulum. [provided by Alliance
        of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        GNA15: Enables G protein-coupled receptor binding activity. Involved in positive
        regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration involved in phospholipase
        C-activating G protein-coupled signaling pathway. Predicted to be located
        in plasma membrane. Predicted to be part of heterotrimeric G-protein complex.
        [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        FLNA: The protein encoded by this gene is an actin-binding protein that crosslinks
        actin filaments and links actin filaments to membrane glycoproteins. The encoded
        protein is involved in remodeling the cytoskeleton to effect changes in cell
        shape and migration. This protein interacts with integrins, transmembrane
        receptor complexes, and second messengers. Defects in this gene are a cause
        of several syndromes, including periventricular nodular heterotopias (PVNH1,
        PVNH4), otopalatodigital syndromes (OPD1, OPD2), frontometaphyseal dysplasia
        (FMD), Melnick-Needles syndrome (MNS), and X-linked congenital idiopathic
        intestinal pseudoobstruction (CIIPX). Two transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2009]


        GNAS: This locus has a highly complex imprinted expression pattern. It gives
        rise to maternally, paternally, and biallelically expressed transcripts that
        are derived from four alternative promoters and 5'' exons. Some transcripts
        contain a differentially methylated region (DMR) at their 5'' exons, and this
        DMR is commonly found in imprinted genes and correlates with transcript expression.
        An antisense transcript is produced from an overlapping locus on the opposite
        strand. One of the transcripts produced from this locus, and the antisense
        transcript, are paternally expressed noncoding RNAs, and may regulate imprinting
        in this region. In addition, one of the transcripts contains a second overlapping
        ORF, which encodes a structurally unrelated protein - Alex. Alternative splicing
        of downstream exons is also observed, which results in different forms of
        the stimulatory G-protein alpha subunit, a key element of the classical signal
        transduction pathway linking receptor-ligand interactions with the activation
        of adenylyl cyclase and a variety of cellular reponses. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Mutations
        in this gene result in pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a, pseudohypoparathyroidism
        type 1b, Albright hereditary osteodystrophy, pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism,

        beta-adrenergic receptor function in vitro. It is expressed at high levels
        in the central nervous system and may play a role in the regulation of synaptic

        Here are the gene summaries:



        DRD1: This gene encodes the D1 subtype of the dopamine receptor. The D1 subtype
        is the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system. This
        G-protein coupled receptor stimulates adenylyl cyclase and activates cyclic
        AMP-dependent protein kinases. D1 receptors regulate neuronal growth and development,
        mediate some behavioral responses, and modulate dopamine receptor D2-mediated
        events. Alternate transcription initiation sites result in two transcript
        variants of this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PTGER1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the G protein-coupled
        receptor family. This protein is one of four receptors identified for prostaglandin
        E2 (PGE2). Through a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system,
        G-Q proteins mediate this receptor''s activity. Knockout studies in mice suggested
        a role of this receptor in mediating algesia and in regulation of blood pressure.
        Studies in mice also suggested that this gene may mediate adrenocorticotropic
        hormone response to bacterial endotoxin. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        SLC1A1: This gene encodes a member of the high-affinity glutamate transporters
        that play an essential role in transporting glutamate across plasma membranes.
        In brain, these transporters are crucial in terminating the postsynaptic action
        of the neurotransmitter glutamate, and in maintaining extracellular glutamate
        concentrations below neurotoxic levels. This transporter also transports aspartate,
        and mutations in this gene are thought to cause dicarboxylicamino aciduria,
        also known as glutamate-aspartate transport defect. [provided by RefSeq, Mar
        2010]


        ADCY6: This gene encodes a member of the adenylyl cyclase family of proteins,
        which are required for the synthesis of cyclic AMP. All members of this family
        have an intracellular N-terminus, a tandem repeat of six transmembrane domains
        separated by a cytoplasmic loop, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The
        two cytoplasmic regions bind ATP and form the catalytic core of the protein.
        Adenylyl cyclases are important effectors of transmembrane signaling pathways
        and are regulated by the activity of G protein coupled receptor signaling.
        This protein belongs to a small subclass of adenylyl cyclase proteins that
        are functionally related and are inhibited by protein kinase A, calcium ions
        and nitric oxide. A mutation in this gene is associated with arthrogryposis
        multiplex congenita. [provided by RefSeq, May 2015]

        GNA15: Enables G protein-coupled receptor binding activity. Involved in positive
        regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration involved in phospholipase
        C-activating G protein-coupled signaling pathway. Predicted to be located
        in plasma membrane. Predicted to be part of heterotrimeric G-protein complex.
        [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        FLNA: The protein encoded by this gene is an actin-binding protein that crosslinks
        actin filaments and links actin filaments to membrane glycoproteins. The encoded
        protein is involved in remodeling the cytoskeleton to effect changes in cell
        shape and migration. This protein interacts with integrins, transmembrane
        receptor complexes, and second messengers. Defects in this gene are a cause
        of several syndromes, including periventricular nodular heterotopias (PVNH1,
        PVNH4), otopalatodigital syndromes (OPD1, OPD2), frontometaphyseal dysplasia
        (FMD), Melnick-Needles syndrome (MNS), and X-linked congenital idiopathic
        intestinal pseudoobstruction (CIIPX). Two transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2009]


        GNAS: This locus has a highly complex imprinted expression pattern. It gives
        rise to maternally, paternally, and biallelically expressed transcripts that
        are derived from four alternative promoters and 5'' exons. Some transcripts
        contain a differentially methylated region (DMR) at their 5'' exons, and this
        DMR is commonly found in imprinted genes and correlates with transcript expression.
        An antisense transcript is produced from an overlapping locus on the opposite
        strand. One of the transcripts produced from this locus, and the antisense
        transcript, are paternally expressed noncoding RNAs, and may regulate imprinting
        in this region. In addition, one of the transcripts contains a second overlapping
        ORF, which encodes a structurally unrelated protein - Alex. Alternative splicing
        of downstream exons is also observed, which results in different forms of
        the stimulatory G-protein alpha subunit, a key element of the classical signal
        transduction pathway linking receptor-ligand interactions with the activation
        of adenylyl cyclase and a variety of cellular reponses. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Mutations
        in this gene result in pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a, pseudohypoparathyroidism
        type 1b, Albright hereditary osteodystrophy, pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism,
        McCune-Albright syndrome, progressive osseus heteroplasia, polyostotic fibrous

        integral membrane proteins, including Notch receptors and beta-amyloid precursor
        protein, and may be a stabilizing cofactor required for gamma-secretase complex
        assembly. The cleavage of beta-amyloid precursor protein yields amyloid beta
        peptide, the main component of the neuritic plaque and the hallmark lesion
        in the brains of patients with Alzheimer''s disease; however, the nature of
        the encoded protein''s role in Alzheimer''s disease is not known for certain.
        Mutations in this gene are associated with familial acne inversa. A pseudogene
        of this gene is present on chromosome 21. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some
        of these variants has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        DRD4: This gene encodes the D4 subtype of the dopamine receptor. The D4 subtype
        is a G-protein coupled receptor which inhibits adenylyl cyclase. It is a target
        for drugs which treat schizophrenia and Parkinson disease. Mutations in this
        gene have been associated with various behavioral phenotypes, including autonomic
        nervous system dysfunction, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and
        the personality trait of novelty seeking. This gene contains a polymorphic
        number (2-10 copies) of tandem 48 nt repeats; the sequence shown contains
        four repeats. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        DRD5: This gene encodes the D5 subtype of the dopamine receptor. The D5 subtype
        is a G-protein coupled receptor which stimulates adenylyl cyclase. This receptor
        is expressed in neurons in the limbic regions of the brain. It has a 10-fold
        higher affinity for dopamine than the D1 subtype. Pseudogenes related to this
        gene reside on chromosomes 1 and 2. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        GNA11: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the family of guanine nucleotide-binding
        proteins (G proteins), which function as modulators or transducers in various
        transmembrane signaling systems. G proteins are composed of 3 units: alpha,
        beta and gamma. This gene encodes one of the alpha subunits (subunit alpha-11).
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with hypocalciuric hypercalcemia
        type II (HHC2) and hypocalcemia dominant 2 (HYPOC2). Patients with HHC2 and
        HYPOC2 exhibit decreased or increased sensitivity, respectively, to changes
        in extracellular calcium concentrations. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2013]


        GNB5: Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), which
        integrate signals between receptors and effector proteins, are composed of
        an alpha, a beta, and a gamma subunit. These subunits are encoded by families
        of related genes. This gene encodes a beta subunit. Beta subunits are important
        regulators of alpha subunits, as well as of certain signal transduction receptors
        and effectors. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms exist. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        CALY: The protein encoded by this gene is a type II single transmembrane protein.
        It is required for maximal stimulated calcium release after stimulation of
        purinergic or muscarinic but not beta-adrenergic receptors. The encoded protein
        interacts with D1 dopamine receptor and may interact with other DA receptor
        subtypes and/or GPCRs. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        GNG2: This gene encodes one of the gamma subunits of a guanine nucleotide-binding
        protein. Such proteins are involved in signaling mechanisms across membranes.
        Various subunits forms heterodimers which then interact with the different
        signal molecules. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        DRD1: This gene encodes the D1 subtype of the dopamine receptor. The D1 subtype
        is the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system. This
        G-protein coupled receptor stimulates adenylyl cyclase and activates cyclic
        AMP-dependent protein kinases. D1 receptors regulate neuronal growth and development,
        mediate some behavioral responses, and modulate dopamine receptor D2-mediated
        events. Alternate transcription initiation sites result in two transcript
        variants of this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        GNAQ: This locus encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein. The encoded
        protein, an alpha subunit in the Gq class, couples a seven-transmembrane domain
        receptor to activation of phospolipase C-beta. Mutations at this locus have
        been associated with problems in platelet activation and aggregation. A related
        pseudogene exists on chromosome 2.[provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010]


        NCSTN: This gene encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is an integral
        component of the multimeric gamma-secretase complex. The encoded protein cleaves
        integral membrane proteins, including Notch receptors and beta-amyloid precursor
        protein, and may be a stabilizing cofactor required for gamma-secretase complex
        assembly. The cleavage of beta-amyloid precursor protein yields amyloid beta
        peptide, the main component of the neuritic plaque and the hallmark lesion
        in the brains of patients with Alzheimer''s disease; however, the nature of
        the encoded protein''s role in Alzheimer''s disease is not known for certain.
        Mutations in this gene are associated with familial acne inversa. A pseudogene
        of this gene is present on chromosome 21. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some
        of these variants has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        GNAI3: Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as modulators
        or transducers in various transmembrane signaling pathways. G proteins are
        composed of 3 units: alpha, beta and gamma. This gene encodes an alpha subunit
        and belongs to the G-alpha family. Mutation in this gene, resulting in a gly40-to-arg
        substitution, is associated with auriculocondylar syndrome, and shown to affect
        downstream targets in the G protein-coupled endothelin receptor pathway. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jun 2012]


        GSK3A: This gene encodes a multifunctional Ser/Thr protein kinase that is
        implicated in the control of several regulatory proteins including glycogen
        synthase, and transcription factors, such as JUN. It also plays a role in
        the WNT and PI3K signaling pathways, as well as regulates the production of
        beta-amyloid peptides associated with Alzheimer''s disease. [provided by RefSeq,
        Oct 2011]


        ADCY6: This gene encodes a member of the adenylyl cyclase family of proteins,
        which are required for the synthesis of cyclic AMP. All members of this family
        have an intracellular N-terminus, a tandem repeat of six transmembrane domains
        separated by a cytoplasmic loop, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The
        two cytoplasmic regions bind ATP and form the catalytic core of the protein.
        Adenylyl cyclases are important effectors of transmembrane signaling pathways
        and are regulated by the activity of G protein coupled receptor signaling.
        This protein belongs to a small subclass of adenylyl cyclase proteins that
        are functionally related and are inhibited by protein kinase A, calcium ions
        and nitric oxide. A mutation in this gene is associated with arthrogryposis
        multiplex congenita. [provided by RefSeq, May 2015]


        DRD2: This gene encodes the D2 subtype of the dopamine receptor. This G-protein
        coupled receptor inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity. A missense mutation in
        this gene causes myoclonus dystonia; other mutations have been associated
        with schizophrenia. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms. A third variant has been described,
        but it has not been determined whether this form is normal or due to aberrant
        splicing. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ADCY5: This gene encodes a member of the membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase enzymes.
        Adenylyl cyclases mediate G protein-coupled receptor signaling through the
        synthesis of the second messenger cAMP. Activity of the encoded protein is
        stimulated by the Gs alpha subunit of G protein-coupled receptors and is inhibited
        by protein kinase A, calcium and Gi alpha subunits. Single nucleotide polymorphisms
        in this gene may be associated with low birth weight and type 2 diabetes.
        Alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different isoforms have
        been observed for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2010]


        GNB5: Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), which
        integrate signals between receptors and effector proteins, are composed of
        an alpha, a beta, and a gamma subunit. These subunits are encoded by families
        of related genes. This gene encodes a beta subunit. Beta subunits are important
        regulators of alpha subunits, as well as of certain signal transduction receptors
        and effectors. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms exist. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        DRD3: This gene encodes the D3 subtype of the five (D1-D5) dopamine receptors.
        The activity of the D3 subtype receptor is mediated by G proteins which inhibit
        adenylyl cyclase. This receptor is localized to the limbic areas of the brain,
        which are associated with cognitive, emotional, and endocrine functions. Genetic
        variation in this gene may be associated with susceptibility to hereditary
        essential tremor 1. Alternative splicing of this gene results in transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms, although some variants may be subject
        to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        NSG1: Predicted to enable clathrin light chain binding activity. Involved
        in apoptotic process. Located in endoplasmic reticulum. [provided by Alliance
        of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        ARRB2: Members of arrestin/beta-arrestin protein family are thought to participate
        in agonist-mediated desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors and cause
        specific dampening of cellular responses to stimuli such as hormones, neurotransmitters,
        or sensory signals. Arrestin beta 2, like arrestin beta 1, was shown to inhibit
        beta-adrenergic receptor function in vitro. It is expressed at high levels
        in the central nervous system and may play a role in the regulation of synaptic
        receptors. Besides the brain, a cDNA for arrestin beta 2 was isolated from
        thyroid gland, and thus it may also be involved in hormone-specific desensitization
        of TSH receptors. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar
        2012]


        SLC1A1: This gene encodes a member of the high-affinity glutamate transporters
        that play an essential role in transporting glutamate across plasma membranes.
        In brain, these transporters are crucial in terminating the postsynaptic action

        GNAS: This locus has a highly complex imprinted expression pattern. It gives
        rise to maternally, paternally, and biallelically expressed transcripts that
        are derived from four alternative promoters and 5'' exons. Some transcripts
        contain a differentially methylated region (DMR) at their 5'' exons, and this
        DMR is commonly found in imprinted genes and correlates with transcript expression.
        An antisense transcript is produced from an overlapping locus on the opposite
        strand. One of the transcripts produced from this locus, and the antisense
        transcript, are paternally expressed noncoding RNAs, and may regulate imprinting
        in this region. In addition, one of the transcripts contains a second overlapping
        ORF, which encodes a structurally unrelated protein - Alex. Alternative splicing
        of downstream exons is also observed, which results in different forms of
        the stimulatory G-protein alpha subunit, a key element of the classical signal
        transduction pathway linking receptor-ligand interactions with the activation
        of adenylyl cyclase and a variety of cellular reponses. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Mutations

        Here are the gene summaries:



        DRD1: This gene encodes the D1 subtype of the dopamine receptor. The D1 subtype
        is the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system. This
        G-protein coupled receptor stimulates adenylyl cyclase and activates cyclic
        AMP-dependent protein kinases. D1 receptors regulate neuronal growth and development,
        mediate some behavioral responses, and modulate dopamine receptor D2-mediated
        events. Alternate transcription initiation sites result in two transcript
        variants of this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        GNAQ: This locus encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein. The encoded
        protein, an alpha subunit in the Gq class, couples a seven-transmembrane domain
        receptor to activation of phospolipase C-beta. Mutations at this locus have
        been associated with problems in platelet activation and aggregation. A related
        pseudogene exists on chromosome 2.[provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010]


        NCSTN: This gene encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is an integral
        component of the multimeric gamma-secretase complex. The encoded protein cleaves
        integral membrane proteins, including Notch receptors and beta-amyloid precursor
        protein, and may be a stabilizing cofactor required for gamma-secretase complex
        assembly. The cleavage of beta-amyloid precursor protein yields amyloid beta
        peptide, the main component of the neuritic plaque and the hallmark lesion
        in the brains of patients with Alzheimer''s disease; however, the nature of
        the encoded protein''s role in Alzheimer''s disease is not known for certain.
        Mutations in this gene are associated with familial acne inversa. A pseudogene
        of this gene is present on chromosome 21. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some
        of these variants has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        GNAI3: Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as modulators
        or transducers in various transmembrane signaling pathways. G proteins are
        composed of 3 units: alpha, beta and gamma. This gene encodes an alpha subunit
        and belongs to the G-alpha family. Mutation in this gene, resulting in a gly40-to-arg
        substitution, is associated with auriculocondylar syndrome, and shown to affect
        downstream targets in the G protein-coupled endothelin receptor pathway. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jun 2012]


        GSK3A: This gene encodes a multifunctional Ser/Thr protein kinase that is
        implicated in the control of several regulatory proteins including glycogen
        synthase, and transcription factors, such as JUN. It also plays a role in
        the WNT and PI3K signaling pathways, as well as regulates the production of
        beta-amyloid peptides associated with Alzheimer''s disease. [provided by RefSeq,
        Oct 2011]


        ADCY6: This gene encodes a member of the adenylyl cyclase family of proteins,
        which are required for the synthesis of cyclic AMP. All members of this family
        have an intracellular N-terminus, a tandem repeat of six transmembrane domains
        separated by a cytoplasmic loop, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The
        two cytoplasmic regions bind ATP and form the catalytic core of the protein.
        Adenylyl cyclases are important effectors of transmembrane signaling pathways
        and are regulated by the activity of G protein coupled receptor signaling.
        This protein belongs to a small subclass of adenylyl cyclase proteins that
        are functionally related and are inhibited by protein kinase A, calcium ions
        and nitric oxide. A mutation in this gene is associated with arthrogryposis
        multiplex congenita. [provided by RefSeq, May 2015]


        DRD2: This gene encodes the D2 subtype of the dopamine receptor. This G-protein
        coupled receptor inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity. A missense mutation in
        this gene causes myoclonus dystonia; other mutations have been associated
        with schizophrenia. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms. A third variant has been described,
        but it has not been determined whether this form is normal or due to aberrant
        splicing. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ADCY5: This gene encodes a member of the membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase enzymes.
        Adenylyl cyclases mediate G protein-coupled receptor signaling through the
        synthesis of the second messenger cAMP. Activity of the encoded protein is
        stimulated by the Gs alpha subunit of G protein-coupled receptors and is inhibited
        by protein kinase A, calcium and Gi alpha subunits. Single nucleotide polymorphisms
        in this gene may be associated with low birth weight and type 2 diabetes.
        Alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different isoforms have
        been observed for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2010]

        of related genes. This gene encodes a beta subunit. Beta subunits are important
        regulators of alpha subunits, as well as of certain signal transduction receptors
        and effectors. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms exist. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        DRD3: This gene encodes the D3 subtype of the five (D1-D5) dopamine receptors.
        The activity of the D3 subtype receptor is mediated by G proteins which inhibit
        adenylyl cyclase. This receptor is localized to the limbic areas of the brain,
        which are associated with cognitive, emotional, and endocrine functions. Genetic
        variation in this gene may be associated with susceptibility to hereditary
        essential tremor 1. Alternative splicing of this gene results in transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms, although some variants may be subject
        to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        NSG1: Predicted to enable clathrin light chain binding activity. Involved
        in apoptotic process. Located in endoplasmic reticulum. [provided by Alliance
        of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        ARRB2: Members of arrestin/beta-arrestin protein family are thought to participate
        in agonist-mediated desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors and cause
        specific dampening of cellular responses to stimuli such as hormones, neurotransmitters,
        or sensory signals. Arrestin beta 2, like arrestin beta 1, was shown to inhibit
        beta-adrenergic receptor function in vitro. It is expressed at high levels
        in the central nervous system and may play a role in the regulation of synaptic
        receptors. Besides the brain, a cDNA for arrestin beta 2 was isolated from
        thyroid gland, and thus it may also be involved in hormone-specific desensitization
        of TSH receptors. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar
        2012]


        SLC1A1: This gene encodes a member of the high-affinity glutamate transporters
        that play an essential role in transporting glutamate across plasma membranes.
        In brain, these transporters are crucial in terminating the postsynaptic action
        of the neurotransmitter glutamate, and in maintaining extracellular glutamate
        concentrations below neurotoxic levels. This transporter also transports aspartate,
        and mutations in this gene are thought to cause dicarboxylicamino aciduria,
        also known as glutamate-aspartate transport defect. [provided by RefSeq, Mar

        Here are the gene summaries:



        DRD1: This gene encodes the D1 subtype of the dopamine receptor. The D1 subtype
        is the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system. This
        G-protein coupled receptor stimulates adenylyl cyclase and activates cyclic
        AMP-dependent protein kinases. D1 receptors regulate neuronal growth and development,
        mediate some behavioral responses, and modulate dopamine receptor D2-mediated
        events. Alternate transcription initiation sites result in two transcript
        variants of this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        GNAQ: This locus encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein. The encoded
        protein, an alpha subunit in the Gq class, couples a seven-transmembrane domain
        receptor to activation of phospolipase C-beta. Mutations at this locus have
        been associated with problems in platelet activation and aggregation. A related
        pseudogene exists on chromosome 2.[provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010]


        NCSTN: This gene encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is an integral
        component of the multimeric gamma-secretase complex. The encoded protein cleaves
        integral membrane proteins, including Notch receptors and beta-amyloid precursor
        protein, and may be a stabilizing cofactor required for gamma-secretase complex
        assembly. The cleavage of beta-amyloid precursor protein yields amyloid beta
        peptide, the main component of the neuritic plaque and the hallmark lesion
        in the brains of patients with Alzheimer''s disease; however, the nature of
        the encoded protein''s role in Alzheimer''s disease is not known for certain.
        Mutations in this gene are associated with familial acne inversa. A pseudogene
        of this gene is present on chromosome 21. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some
        of these variants has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        GNAI3: Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as modulators
        or transducers in various transmembrane signaling pathways. G proteins are
        composed of 3 units: alpha, beta and gamma. This gene encodes an alpha subunit
        and belongs to the G-alpha family. Mutation in this gene, resulting in a gly40-to-arg
        substitution, is associated with auriculocondylar syndrome, and shown to affect
        downstream targets in the G protein-coupled endothelin receptor pathway. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jun 2012]


        GSK3A: This gene encodes a multifunctional Ser/Thr protein kinase that is
        implicated in the control of several regulatory proteins including glycogen
        synthase, and transcription factors, such as JUN. It also plays a role in
        the WNT and PI3K signaling pathways, as well as regulates the production of
        beta-amyloid peptides associated with Alzheimer''s disease. [provided by RefSeq,
        Oct 2011]


        ADCY6: This gene encodes a member of the adenylyl cyclase family of proteins,
        which are required for the synthesis of cyclic AMP. All members of this family
        have an intracellular N-terminus, a tandem repeat of six transmembrane domains
        separated by a cytoplasmic loop, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The
        two cytoplasmic regions bind ATP and form the catalytic core of the protein.
        Adenylyl cyclases are important effectors of transmembrane signaling pathways
        and are regulated by the activity of G protein coupled receptor signaling.
        This protein belongs to a small subclass of adenylyl cyclase proteins that
        are functionally related and are inhibited by protein kinase A, calcium ions
        and nitric oxide. A mutation in this gene is associated with arthrogryposis
        multiplex congenita. [provided by RefSeq, May 2015]


        DRD2: This gene encodes the D2 subtype of the dopamine receptor. This G-protein
        coupled receptor inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity. A missense mutation in
        this gene causes myoclonus dystonia; other mutations have been associated
        with schizophrenia. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms. A third variant has been described,
        but it has not been determined whether this form is normal or due to aberrant
        splicing. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ADCY5: This gene encodes a member of the membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase enzymes.
        Adenylyl cyclases mediate G protein-coupled receptor signaling through the
        synthesis of the second messenger cAMP. Activity of the encoded protein is
        stimulated by the Gs alpha subunit of G protein-coupled receptors and is inhibited
        by protein kinase A, calcium and Gi alpha subunits. Single nucleotide polymorphisms
        in this gene may be associated with low birth weight and type 2 diabetes.
        Alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different isoforms have
        been observed for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2010]


        GNB5: Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), which
        integrate signals between receptors and effector proteins, are composed of
        an alpha, a beta, and a gamma subunit. These subunits are encoded by families
        of related genes. This gene encodes a beta subunit. Beta subunits are important
        regulators of alpha subunits, as well as of certain signal transduction receptors
        and effectors. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms exist. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        DRD3: This gene encodes the D3 subtype of the five (D1-D5) dopamine receptors.
        The activity of the D3 subtype receptor is mediated by G proteins which inhibit
        adenylyl cyclase. This receptor is localized to the limbic areas of the brain,
        which are associated with cognitive, emotional, and endocrine functions. Genetic
        variation in this gene may be associated with susceptibility to hereditary
        essential tremor 1. Alternative splicing of this gene results in transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms, although some variants may be subject
        to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        NSG1: Predicted to enable clathrin light chain binding activity. Involved
        in apoptotic process. Located in endoplasmic reticulum. [provided by Alliance
        of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        ARRB2: Members of arrestin/beta-arrestin protein family are thought to participate
        in agonist-mediated desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors and cause
        specific dampening of cellular responses to stimuli such as hormones, neurotransmitters,
        or sensory signals. Arrestin beta 2, like arrestin beta 1, was shown to inhibit
        beta-adrenergic receptor function in vitro. It is expressed at high levels
        in the central nervous system and may play a role in the regulation of synaptic
        receptors. Besides the brain, a cDNA for arrestin beta 2 was isolated from
        thyroid gland, and thus it may also be involved in hormone-specific desensitization
        of TSH receptors. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar
        2012]


        SLC1A1: This gene encodes a member of the high-affinity glutamate transporters
        that play an essential role in transporting glutamate across plasma membranes.
        In brain, these transporters are crucial in terminating the postsynaptic action
        of the neurotransmitter glutamate, and in maintaining extracellular glutamate
        concentrations below neurotoxic levels. This transporter also transports aspartate,
        and mutations in this gene are thought to cause dicarboxylicamino aciduria,
        also known as glutamate-aspartate transport defect. [provided by RefSeq, Mar
        2010]


        PTGER1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the G protein-coupled
        receptor family. This protein is one of four receptors identified for prostaglandin
        E2 (PGE2). Through a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system,
        G-Q proteins mediate this receptor''s activity. Knockout studies in mice suggested
        a role of this receptor in mediating algesia and in regulation of blood pressure.

        GNAS: This locus has a highly complex imprinted expression pattern. It gives
        rise to maternally, paternally, and biallelically expressed transcripts that
        are derived from four alternative promoters and 5'' exons. Some transcripts
        contain a differentially methylated region (DMR) at their 5'' exons, and this
        DMR is commonly found in imprinted genes and correlates with transcript expression.
        An antisense transcript is produced from an overlapping locus on the opposite
        strand. One of the transcripts produced from this locus, and the antisense
        transcript, are paternally expressed noncoding RNAs, and may regulate imprinting
        in this region. In addition, one of the transcripts contains a second overlapping
        ORF, which encodes a structurally unrelated protein - Alex. Alternative splicing
        of downstream exons is also observed, which results in different forms of
        the stimulatory G-protein alpha subunit, a key element of the classical signal
        transduction pathway linking receptor-ligand interactions with the activation
        of adenylyl cyclase and a variety of cellular reponses. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Mutations
        in this gene result in pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a, pseudohypoparathyroidism
        type 1b, Albright hereditary osteodystrophy, pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism,

        is a G-protein coupled receptor which stimulates adenylyl cyclase. This receptor
        is expressed in neurons in the limbic regions of the brain. It has a 10-fold
        higher affinity for dopamine than the D1 subtype. Pseudogenes related to this
        gene reside on chromosomes 1 and 2. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        DRD1: This gene encodes the D1 subtype of the dopamine receptor. The D1 subtype
        is the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system. This
        G-protein coupled receptor stimulates adenylyl cyclase and activates cyclic
        AMP-dependent protein kinases. D1 receptors regulate neuronal growth and development,
        mediate some behavioral responses, and modulate dopamine receptor D2-mediated
        events. Alternate transcription initiation sites result in two transcript
        variants of this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        GNAQ: This locus encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein. The encoded
        protein, an alpha subunit in the Gq class, couples a seven-transmembrane domain
        receptor to activation of phospolipase C-beta. Mutations at this locus have
        been associated with problems in platelet activation and aggregation. A related
        pseudogene exists on chromosome 2.[provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010]


        NCSTN: This gene encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is an integral
        component of the multimeric gamma-secretase complex. The encoded protein cleaves
        integral membrane proteins, including Notch receptors and beta-amyloid precursor
        protein, and may be a stabilizing cofactor required for gamma-secretase complex
        assembly. The cleavage of beta-amyloid precursor protein yields amyloid beta
        peptide, the main component of the neuritic plaque and the hallmark lesion
        in the brains of patients with Alzheimer''s disease; however, the nature of
        the encoded protein''s role in Alzheimer''s disease is not known for certain.
        Mutations in this gene are associated with familial acne inversa. A pseudogene
        of this gene is present on chromosome 21. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some
        of these variants has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        GNAI3: Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as modulators
        or transducers in various transmembrane signaling pathways. G proteins are
        composed of 3 units: alpha, beta and gamma. This gene encodes an alpha subunit
        and belongs to the G-alpha family. Mutation in this gene, resulting in a gly40-to-arg
        substitution, is associated with auriculocondylar syndrome, and shown to affect
        downstream targets in the G protein-coupled endothelin receptor pathway. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jun 2012]


        GSK3A: This gene encodes a multifunctional Ser/Thr protein kinase that is
        implicated in the control of several regulatory proteins including glycogen
        synthase, and transcription factors, such as JUN. It also plays a role in
        the WNT and PI3K signaling pathways, as well as regulates the production of
        beta-amyloid peptides associated with Alzheimer''s disease. [provided by RefSeq,
        Oct 2011]


        ADCY6: This gene encodes a member of the adenylyl cyclase family of proteins,
        which are required for the synthesis of cyclic AMP. All members of this family
        have an intracellular N-terminus, a tandem repeat of six transmembrane domains
        separated by a cytoplasmic loop, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The
        two cytoplasmic regions bind ATP and form the catalytic core of the protein.
        Adenylyl cyclases are important effectors of transmembrane signaling pathways
        and are regulated by the activity of G protein coupled receptor signaling.
        This protein belongs to a small subclass of adenylyl cyclase proteins that
        are functionally related and are inhibited by protein kinase A, calcium ions
        and nitric oxide. A mutation in this gene is associated with arthrogryposis
        multiplex congenita. [provided by RefSeq, May 2015]


        DRD2: This gene encodes the D2 subtype of the dopamine receptor. This G-protein
        coupled receptor inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity. A missense mutation in
        this gene causes myoclonus dystonia; other mutations have been associated
        with schizophrenia. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms. A third variant has been described,
        but it has not been determined whether this form is normal or due to aberrant
        splicing. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ADCY5: This gene encodes a member of the membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase enzymes.
        Adenylyl cyclases mediate G protein-coupled receptor signaling through the
        synthesis of the second messenger cAMP. Activity of the encoded protein is
        stimulated by the Gs alpha subunit of G protein-coupled receptors and is inhibited
        by protein kinase A, calcium and Gi alpha subunits. Single nucleotide polymorphisms
        in this gene may be associated with low birth weight and type 2 diabetes.
        Alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different isoforms have
        been observed for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2010]


        GNB5: Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), which
        integrate signals between receptors and effector proteins, are composed of
        an alpha, a beta, and a gamma subunit. These subunits are encoded by families
        of related genes. This gene encodes a beta subunit. Beta subunits are important
        regulators of alpha subunits, as well as of certain signal transduction receptors
        and effectors. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms exist. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        DRD3: This gene encodes the D3 subtype of the five (D1-D5) dopamine receptors.
        The activity of the D3 subtype receptor is mediated by G proteins which inhibit
        adenylyl cyclase. This receptor is localized to the limbic areas of the brain,
        which are associated with cognitive, emotional, and endocrine functions. Genetic
        variation in this gene may be associated with susceptibility to hereditary
        essential tremor 1. Alternative splicing of this gene results in transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms, although some variants may be subject
        to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        NSG1: Predicted to enable clathrin light chain binding activity. Involved
        in apoptotic process. Located in endoplasmic reticulum. [provided by Alliance
        of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        ARRB2: Members of arrestin/beta-arrestin protein family are thought to participate
        in agonist-mediated desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors and cause
        specific dampening of cellular responses to stimuli such as hormones, neurotransmitters,
        or sensory signals. Arrestin beta 2, like arrestin beta 1, was shown to inhibit
        beta-adrenergic receptor function in vitro. It is expressed at high levels
        in the central nervous system and may play a role in the regulation of synaptic
        receptors. Besides the brain, a cDNA for arrestin beta 2 was isolated from
        thyroid gland, and thus it may also be involved in hormone-specific desensitization
        of TSH receptors. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar
        2012]


        SLC1A1: This gene encodes a member of the high-affinity glutamate transporters
        that play an essential role in transporting glutamate across plasma membranes.
        In brain, these transporters are crucial in terminating the postsynaptic action
        of the neurotransmitter glutamate, and in maintaining extracellular glutamate
        concentrations below neurotoxic levels. This transporter also transports aspartate,
        and mutations in this gene are thought to cause dicarboxylicamino aciduria,
        also known as glutamate-aspartate transport defect. [provided by RefSeq, Mar
        2010]


        PTGER1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the G protein-coupled
        receptor family. This protein is one of four receptors identified for prostaglandin
        E2 (PGE2). Through a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system,
        G-Q proteins mediate this receptor''s activity. Knockout studies in mice suggested
        a role of this receptor in mediating algesia and in regulation of blood pressure.
        Studies in mice also suggested that this gene may mediate adrenocorticotropic
        hormone response to bacterial endotoxin. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        gene expression, and synaptic receptors.


        Mechanism: This gene set is involved in many pathways such as signal transduction,
        transcriptional regulation, and synaptic organization. Signal transduction
        occurs through G-protein coupled receptors and cAMP, which in turn regulate
        downstream effectors including adenylyl cyclase, protein kinase A, and calcium
        ions. Furthermore, transcriptional regulation occurs through various receptor
        signaling pathways, such as those related to the WNT and PI3K pathways, while
        dopamine receptors regulate neuronal growth and development, gene expression,
        and behavior. Finally, synaptic receptors enable'
