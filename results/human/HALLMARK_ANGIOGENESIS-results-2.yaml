        reduces the amount of thrombin ...


        TIMP1: This gene belongs to the TIMP gene family. The proteins encoded by
        this gene family are natural inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
        a group of peptidases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        In addition to its inhibitory role against most of the known MMPs, the encoded
        protein is able to promote cell proliferation in a wide range of cell types,

        role in tissue morphogenesis and ma...


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expr...


        VTN: The protein encoded by this gene functions in part as an adhesive glycoprotein.
        Differential expression of this protein can promote either cell adhesion or
        migration as it links cells to the extracellular matrix through a variety
        of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1,
        and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be
        present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular
        matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging
        effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpin
        serine protease inhibitors. This protein can also promote extracellular matrix
        degr...

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        activation of protein C, which degrades clotting factors Va and VIIIa and
        reduces the amount of thrombin ...


        TIMP1: This gene belongs to the TIMP gene family. The proteins encoded by
        this gene family are natural inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
        a group of peptidases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        In addition to its inhibitory role against most of the known MMPs, the encoded
        protein is able to promote cell proliferation in a wide range of cell types,
        and may also have an anti-apoptotic function. Transcription of this gene is
        highly inducible in response to many cytokines and ho...


        TNFRSF21: This gene encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor
        superfamily. The encoded protein activates nuclear factor kappa-B and mitogen-activated
        protein kinase 8 (also called c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1), and induces cell

        proliferation, proliferation, migration and angiogenesis and plays a central
        role in tissue morphogenesis and ma...


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expr...


        VTN: The protein encoded by this gene functions in part as an adhesive glycoprotein.
        Differential expression of this protein can promote either cell adhesion or
        migration as it links cells to the extracellular matrix through a variety
        of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1,
        and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be
        present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular
        matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging
        effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpin

        role in tissue morphogenesis and ma...


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expr...


        VTN: The protein encoded by this gene functions in part as an adhesive glycoprotein.
        Differential expression of this protein can promote either cell adhesion or
        migration as it links cells to the extracellular matrix through a variety
        of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1,
        and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be
        present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular
        matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging
        effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpin
        serine protease inhibitors. This protein can also promote extracellular matrix
        degr...

        family that includes decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, keratocan, epiphycan,
        and osteoglycin. In these bifunctional molecules, the protein moiety binds
        collagen fibrils and the highly charged hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans regulate
        interfibrillar spacings. Lumican is the major keratan sulfate proteoglycan
        of the cornea but is also distributed i...


        FGFR1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth
        factor receptor (FGFR) family, where amino acid sequence is highly conserved
        between members and throughout evolution. FGFR family members differ from
        one another in their ligand affinities and tissue distribution. A full-length
        representative protein consists of an extracellular region, composed of three
        immunoglobulin-like domains, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment
        and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular portion of the
        protein interacts with fibroblast growth factors, setting in motion a cascade
        of downstream signals, ultimately influencing mitogenesis and differentiation.
        This particular family member binds both acidic and basic fibroblast growth
        factors and is involved in limb induction. Mutations in this gene have been
        ass...


        CCND2: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin
        family, whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein
        abundance through the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK kinases.
        Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns which
        contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This cyclin
        forms a complex with CDK4 or CDK6 and functions as a regulatory subunit of
        the complex, whose activity is required for cell cycle G1/S transition. This
        protein has been shown to interact with and be involved in the phosphorylation
        of tumor suppressor protein Rb. Knock...

        decisions. The protein encoded by this gene is one of several li...


        VTN: The protein encoded by this gene functions in part as an adhesive glycoprotein.
        Differential expression of this protein can promote either cell adhesion or
        migration as it links cells to the extracellular matrix through a variety
        of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1,
        and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be
        present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular
        matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging
        effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpin
        serine protease inhibitors. This protein can also promote extracellular matrix
        degr...


        NRP1: This gene encodes one of two neuropilins, which contain specific protein
        domains which allow them to participate in several different types of signaling
        pathways that control cell migration. Neuropilins contain a large N-terminal
        extracellular domain, made up of complement-binding, coagulation factor V/VIII,
        and meprin domains. These proteins also contains a short membrane-spanning
        domain and a small cytoplasmic domain. Neuropilins bind many ligands and various
        types of co-receptors; they affect cell survival, migration, and ...

        to the mineralized bone matrix. The encoded protein is secreted and binds
        hydroxyapatite with high affinity. The osteoclast vitronectin receptor is
        found in the cell membrane and may be involved in the binding to this protein.
        This protein is also a cytoki...


        LPL: LPL encodes lipoprotein lipase, which is expressed in heart, muscle,
        and adipose tissue. LPL functions as a homodimer, and has the dual functions
        of triglyceride hydrolase and ligand/bridging factor for receptor-mediated
        lipoprotein uptake. Severe mutations that cause LPL deficiency ...

      summary: " \nThis list of genes includes a variety of molecules that are involved\
        \ in a range of biological processes such as tissue morphogenesis, cell adhesion,\
        \ cell migration, cell survival, signal transduction, cell cycle regulation,\
        \ scaffolding, apoptosis, extracellular matrix production, platelet aggregation\
        \ and others. Most of these molecules are involved in processes related to\
        \ cell-cell or cell-matrix interaction and in particular, formation and/or\
        \ maintenance of the extracellular matrix.\n\nMechanism: These genes likely\
        \ function in the formation and/or maintenance of the extracellular matrix\
        \ via a number of processes. Specifically, these genes may be involved in\
        \ processes such as regulation of cell-cell interactions and cell-matrix interactions,\
        \ production and secretion of extracellular matrix proteins, processing of\
        \ proteoglycans and glycoproteins, scaffolding, cell cycle control, signal\
        \ transduction, and cell adhesion. These processes are likely to be involved\
        \ in the control of tissue morphogenesis, cell migration and survival, platelet\
