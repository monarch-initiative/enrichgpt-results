        AIMP2: The protein encoded by this gene is part of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
        complex, which contains nine different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and three
        non-enzymati...


        BYSL: Bystin is expressed as a 2-kb major transcript and a 3.6-kb minor transcript
        in SNG-M cells and in human trophoblastic teratocarcinoma HT-H cells. Protein
        binding assays determined that bystin binds directly to trophinin and tastin,
        and that binding is enhanced when cytokeratins 8 and 18 are present. Immunocytochemistry
        of HT-H cells showed that bystin colocalizes with trophinin, tastin, and the
        cytokeratins, suggesting that these molecules form a complex in trophectoderm
        cells at...

        CDK4: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Ser/Thr protein
        kinase family. This protein is highly similar to the gene products of S. cerevisiae
        cdc28 and S. pombe cdc2. It is a catalytic subunit of the protein kinase complex
        that is important for cell cycle G1 phase progression. The activity of this
        kinase is restricted to the G1-S phase, which is controlled by the regulatory
        subunits D-type cyclins and C...


        DCTPP1: The protein encoded by this gene is dCTP pyrophosphatase, which converts
        dCTP to dCMP and inorganic pyrophosphate. The encoded protein also displays
        weak activity against dTTP and dATP, but none against dGTP. This protein may
        be responsible for e...

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        frequently observed in numerous human cancers. Translocations involving this
        gene are associated with Burkitt lym...

        the base-excision repair (BER) pathway. Uracil bases occur from cytosine deamination
        or misincorporation of dUMP residues. Alternative promoter usage and splicing
        of this gene leads to two different i...

        BYSL: Bystin is expressed as a 2-kb major transcript and a 3.6-kb minor transcript
        in SNG-M cells and in human trophoblastic teratocarcinoma HT-H cells. Protein
        binding assays determined that bystin binds directly to trophinin and tastin,
        and that binding is enhanced when cytokeratins 8 and 18 are present. Immunocytochemistry
        of HT-H cells showed that bystin colocalizes with trophinin, tastin, and the
        cytokeratins, suggesting that these molecules form a complex in trophectoderm
        cells at the time of implantation. Using immunohistochemistry it was determined
