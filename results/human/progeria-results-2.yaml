        Here are the gene summaries:



        ZMPSTE24: This gene encodes a member of the peptidase M48A family. The encoded
        protein is a zinc metalloproteinase involved in the two step post-translational
        proteolytic cleavage of carboxy terminal residues of farnesylated prelamin
        A to form mature lamin A. Mutations in this gene have been associated with
        mandibuloacral dysplasia and restrictive dermopathy. [provided by RefSeq,
        Jul 2008]


        BANF1: The protein encoded by this gene was first identified by its ability
        to protect retroviruses from intramolecular integration and therefore promote
        intermolecular integration into the host cell genome. The protein forms a
        homodimer which localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm and is specifically
        associated with chromosomes during mitosis. This protein binds to double stranded
        DNA in a non-specific manner and also binds to LEM-domain containing proteins
        of the nuclear envelope. This protein is thought to facilitate nuclear reassembly
        by binding with both DNA and inner nuclear membrane proteins and thereby recruit
        chromatin to the nuclear periphery. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants encoding the same protein.[provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]


        WRN: This gene encodes a member of the RecQ subfamily of DNA helicase proteins.
        The encoded nuclear protein is important in the maintenance of genome stability
        and plays a role in DNA repair, replication, transcription and telomere maintenance.
        This protein contains a N-terminal 3'' to 5'' exonuclease domain, an ATP-dependent
        helicase domain and RQC (RecQ helicase conserved region) domain in its central
        region, and a C-terminal HRDC (helicase RNase D C-terminal) domain and nuclear
        localization signal. Defects in this gene are the cause of Werner syndrome,
        an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by accelerated aging and an
        elevated risk for certain cancers. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        LMNA: The protein encoded by this gene is part of the nuclear lamina, a two-dimensional
        matrix of proteins located next to the inner nuclear membrane. The lamin family
        of proteins make up the matrix and are highly conserved in evolution. During
        mitosis, the lamina matrix is reversibly disassembled as the lamin proteins
        are phosphorylated. Lamin proteins are thought to be involved in nuclear stability,
        chromatin structure and gene expression. Vertebrate lamins consist of two
        types, A and B. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
        Mutations in this gene lead to several diseases: Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy,
        familial partial lipodystrophy, limb girdle muscular dystrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy,
        Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. [provided

        Here are the gene summaries:



        ZMPSTE24: This gene encodes a member of the peptidase M48A family. The encoded
        protein is a zinc metalloproteinase involved in the two step post-translational
        proteolytic cleavage of carboxy terminal residues of farnesylated prelamin
        A to form mature lamin A. Mutations in this gene have been associated with
        mandibuloacral dysplasia and restrictive dermopathy. [provided by RefSeq,
        Jul 2008]


        BANF1: The protein encoded by this gene was first identified by its ability
        to protect retroviruses from intramolecular integration and therefore promote
        intermolecular integration into the host cell genome. The protein forms a
        homodimer which localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm and is specifically
        associated with chromosomes during mitosis. This protein binds to double stranded
        DNA in a non-specific manner and also binds to LEM-domain containing proteins
        of the nuclear envelope. This protein is thought to facilitate nuclear reassembly
        by binding with both DNA and inner nuclear membrane proteins and thereby recruit
        chromatin to the nuclear periphery. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants encoding the same protein.[provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]


        WRN: This gene encodes a member of the RecQ subfamily of DNA helicase proteins.
        The encoded nuclear protein is important in the maintenance of genome stability
        and plays a role in DNA repair, replication, transcription and telomere maintenance.
        This protein contains a N-terminal 3'' to 5'' exonuclease domain, an ATP-dependent
        helicase domain and RQC (RecQ helicase conserved region) domain in its central
        region, and a C-terminal HRDC (helicase RNase D C-terminal) domain and nuclear
        localization signal. Defects in this gene are the cause of Werner syndrome,
        an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by accelerated aging and an
        elevated risk for certain cancers. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        LMNA: The protein encoded by this gene is part of the nuclear lamina, a two-dimensional
        matrix of proteins located next to the inner nuclear membrane. The lamin family
        of proteins make up the matrix and are highly conserved in evolution. During
        mitosis, the lamina matrix is reversibly disassembled as the lamin proteins
        are phosphorylated. Lamin proteins are thought to be involved in nuclear stability,
        chromatin structure and gene expression. Vertebrate lamins consist of two
        types, A and B. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
        Mutations in this gene lead to several diseases: Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy,
        familial partial lipodystrophy, limb girdle muscular dystrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy,
        Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. [provided

        Here are the gene summaries:



        ZMPSTE24: This gene encodes a member of the peptidase M48A family. The encoded
        protein is a zinc metalloproteinase involved in the two step post-translational
        proteolytic cleavage of carboxy terminal residues of farnesylated prelamin
        A to form mature lamin A. Mutations in this gene have been associated with
        mandibuloacral dysplasia and restrictive dermopathy. [provided by RefSeq,
        Jul 2008]


        BANF1: The protein encoded by this gene was first identified by its ability
        to protect retroviruses from intramolecular integration and therefore promote
        intermolecular integration into the host cell genome. The protein forms a
        homodimer which localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm and is specifically
        associated with chromosomes during mitosis. This protein binds to double stranded
        DNA in a non-specific manner and also binds to LEM-domain containing proteins
        of the nuclear envelope. This protein is thought to facilitate nuclear reassembly
        by binding with both DNA and inner nuclear membrane proteins and thereby recruit
        chromatin to the nuclear periphery. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants encoding the same protein.[provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]


        WRN: This gene encodes a member of the RecQ subfamily of DNA helicase proteins.
        The encoded nuclear protein is important in the maintenance of genome stability
        and plays a role in DNA repair, replication, transcription and telomere maintenance.
        This protein contains a N-terminal 3'' to 5'' exonuclease domain, an ATP-dependent

        localization signal. Defects in this gene are the cause of Werner syndrome,

        LMNA: The protein encoded by this gene is part of the nuclear lamina, a two-dimensional
        matrix of proteins located next to the inner nuclear membrane. The lamin family
        of proteins make up the matrix and are highly conserved in evolution. During
        mitosis, the lamina matrix is reversibly disassembled as the lamin proteins
        are phosphorylated. Lamin proteins are thought to be involved in nuclear stability,
        chromatin structure and gene expression. Vertebrate lamins consist of two
        types, A and B. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
        Mutations in this gene lead to several diseases: Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy,
        familial partial lipodystrophy, limb girdle muscular dystrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy,
        Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. [provided
        by RefSeq, May 2022]


        WRN: This gene encodes a member of the RecQ subfamily of DNA helicase proteins.
        The encoded nuclear protein is important in the maintenance of genome stability
        and plays a role in DNA repair, replication, transcription and telomere maintenance.
        This protein contains a N-terminal 3'' to 5'' exonuclease domain, an ATP-dependent
        helicase domain and RQC (RecQ helicase conserved region) domain in its central
        region, and a C-terminal HRDC (helicase RNase D C-terminal) domain and nuclear
        localization signal. Defects in this gene are the cause of Werner syndrome,
        an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by accelerated aging and an
        elevated risk for certain cancers. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        BANF1: The protein encoded by this gene was first identified by its ability
        to protect retroviruses from intramolecular integration and therefore promote
        intermolecular integration into the host cell genome. The protein forms a
        homodimer which localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm and is specifically
        associated with chromosomes during mitosis. This protein binds to double stranded
        DNA in a non-specific manner and also binds to LEM-domain containing proteins
        of the nuclear envelope. This protein is thought to facilitate nuclear reassembly
        by binding with both DNA and inner nuclear membrane proteins and thereby recruit
        chromatin to the nuclear periphery. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants encoding the same protein.[provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        LMNA: The protein encoded by this gene is part of the nuclear lamina, a two-dimensional
        matrix of proteins located next to the inner nuclear membrane. The lamin family
        of proteins make up the matrix and are highly conserved in evolution. During
        mitosis, the lamina matrix is reversibly disassembled as the lamin proteins
        are phosphorylated. Lamin proteins are thought to be involved in nuclear stability,
        chromatin structure and gene expression. Vertebrate lamins consist of two
        types, A and B. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
        Mutations in this gene lead to several diseases: Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy,
        familial partial lipodystrophy, limb girdle muscular dystrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy,
        Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. [provided
        by RefSeq, May 2022]


        WRN: This gene encodes a member of the RecQ subfamily of DNA helicase proteins.
        The encoded nuclear protein is important in the maintenance of genome stability
        and plays a role in DNA repair, replication, transcription and telomere maintenance.
        This protein contains a N-terminal 3'' to 5'' exonuclease domain, an ATP-dependent
        helicase domain and RQC (RecQ helicase conserved region) domain in its central
        region, and a C-terminal HRDC (helicase RNase D C-terminal) domain and nuclear
        localization signal. Defects in this gene are the cause of Werner syndrome,
        an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by accelerated aging and an
        elevated risk for certain cancers. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        BANF1: The protein encoded by this gene was first identified by its ability
        to protect retroviruses from intramolecular integration and therefore promote
        intermolecular integration into the host cell genome. The protein forms a
        homodimer which localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm and is specifically
        associated with chromosomes during mitosis. This protein binds to double stranded
        DNA in a non-specific manner and also binds to LEM-domain containing proteins
        of the nuclear envelope. This protein is thought to facilitate nuclear reassembly
        by binding with both DNA and inner nuclear membrane proteins and thereby recruit
        chromatin to the nuclear periphery. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants encoding the same protein.[provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]

        DNA in a non-specific manner and also binds to LEM-domain containing proteins
        of the nuclear envelope. This protein is thought to facilitate nuclear reassembly
        by binding with both DNA and inner nuclear membrane proteins and thereby recruit
        chromatin to the nuclear periphery. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants encoding the same protein.[provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009]

        Summary and enriched terms:'
      response_text: ' This set of genes is involved in the maintenance of genome
        stability and chromosome integrity, likely in terms of forming the nuclear
        lamina and promoting nuclear reassembly. The enriched terms are genome stability;
        chromosome integrity; nuclear lamina; nuclear reassembly.


        Mechanism: The set of genes are likely working together to form and maintain
        a matrix of proteins which form the nuclear lamina next to the inner nuclear
        membrane, thus providing stability to the genome and the chromosomes by helping
        to organize the DNA within the nucleus. This is achieved through binding with
        both DNA and inner nuclear membrane proteins and recruiting chromatin to the
        nuclear periphery to achieve nuclear reassembly.'
