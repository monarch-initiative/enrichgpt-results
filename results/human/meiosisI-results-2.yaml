        response to DNA damage stimulus and protein export from nucleus. Located in
        cytosol and nu...


        BCL2L11: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the BCL-2 protein family.
        BCL-2 family members form hetero- or homodimers and act as anti- or pro-apoptotic
        regulators that are involved in a wide variety of cellular activities. The
        protein encoded by this gene contains a Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3). It
        has been shown to interact with other members of the BCL-2 protein family
        and to act as an apoptotic activator. The expression of this gene can be induced
        by nerve growth factor (NGF), as well as by the forkhead transcription factor
        FKHR-L1, which suggests a role...


        BRIP1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the RecQ DEAH helicase

        CENPS: This gene was identified in the neuroblastoma tumor suppressor candidate
        region on chromosome 1p36. It contains a TFIID-31 domain, similar to that
        found in TATA box-binding protein-associated factor, TAF(II)31, which is required
        for p53-mediated transcription activation. This gene was expressed at very
        low levels in neuroblastoma tumors, and was shown to reduce cell growth in
        neuroblastoma cells, suggesting that it may have a role in a cell death pathway.
        The protein is a component of multiple complexes, including the Fanconi anemia
        (FA) core complex, the APITD1/CENPS complex, and the CENPA-CAD (nucleosome
        distal) complex. Known functions include an involvement with chromatin associations

        CENPS: This gene was identified in the neuroblastoma tumor suppressor candidate
        region on chromosome 1p36. It contains a TFIID-31 domain, similar to that
        found in TATA box-binding protein-associated factor, TAF(II)31, which is required
        for p53-mediated transcription activation. This gene was expressed at very
        low levels in neuroblastoma tumors, and was shown to reduce cell growth in
        neuroblastoma cells, suggesting that it may have a role in a cell death pathway.

        and the relief of torsional stress that occurs during DNA transcription and
        replication. It catalyzes the transient breaking and rejoining of two strands
        of duplex DNA which allows the strands to pass through one another, thus altering
        the topology of DNA. Two forms of this enzyme exist as likely products of

        CENPS: This gene was identified in the neuroblastoma tumor suppressor candidate
        region on chromosome 1p36. It contains a TFIID-31 domain, similar to that
        found in TATA box-binding protein-associated factor, TAF(II)31, which is required
        for p53-mediated transcription activation. This gene was expressed at very
        low levels in neuroblastoma tumors, and was shown to reduce cell growth in
        neuroblastoma cells, suggesting that it may have a role in a cell death pathway.
        The protein is a component of multiple complexes, including the Fanconi anemia
        (FA) core complex, the APITD1/CENPS complex, and the CENPA-CAD (nucleosome

        TOP2B: This gene encodes a DNA topoisomerase, an enzyme that controls and

        is involved in processes such as chromosome condensation, chromatid separation,
        and the relief of torsional stress that occurs during DNA transcription and
        replication. It catalyzes the transient breaking and rejoining of two strands
        of duplex DNA which allows the strands to pass through one another, thus altering
        the topology of DNA. Two forms of this enzyme exist as likely products of
        a gene duplication event. The gene encoding this form, beta, is localized
        to chromosome 3 and the alpha form is localized to ...

        RAD51 family members are highly similar to bacterial RecA and Saccharomyces
        cerevisiae Rad51, and are known to be involved in the homologous recombination
        and repair of DNA. This protein can interact with the ssDNA-binding protein
        RPA and RAD52, and it is thought to play roles in homologous pairing and strand
        transfer of DNA. This protein is also found to interact with BRCA1 and BRCA2,

        region on chromosome 1p36. It contains a TFIID-31 domain, similar to that
        found in TATA box-binding protein-associated factor, TAF(II)31, which is required
        for p53-mediated transcription activation. This gene was expressed at very
        low levels in neuroblastoma tumors, and was shown to reduce cell growth in
        neuroblastoma cells, suggesting that it may have a role in a cell death pathway.

      summary: " \n\nSummary: The human genes in this list appear to be associated\
        \ with processes such as DNA double-strand break repair, meiosis, homologous\
        \ chromosome pairing, and chromosome synapsis.\n\nMechanism: These genes likely\
        \ play a role in homologous recombination, a key process in meiotic division\
        \ and DNA double-strand break repair. The genes likely work together to form\
        \ various complexes, such as the FA core complex, the APITD1/CENPS complex,\
        \ and the CENPA-CAD (nucleosome distal) complex.\n\n"
