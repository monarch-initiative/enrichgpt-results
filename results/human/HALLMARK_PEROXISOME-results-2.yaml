        functions and enzyme activities related to lipid and fatty acid metabolism.
        Additionally, some genes are involved in binding and catalytic functions related

        Enriched Terms: lipid metabolism; fatty acid metabolism; transport; enzyme

        Mechanism and Hypothesis: These genes are involved in several functions that
        are key to cellular metabolism and homeostasis. Lipid and fatty acid metabolism
        are essential for maintaining membrane integrity and cellular signaling processes.
        Transporters and enzymes related to these functions are necessary for proper
        uptake, utilization, and metabolism of lipids and fatty acids. Additionally,
        retinoids and steroids are important signaling molecules that can be involved
        in metabolic processes and cellular differentiation. The presence of these
        genes suggests that dysregulation of lipid, fatty acid, retinoid, or steroid
        metabolism could lead to disease states such as metabolic disorders, cancer,

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1

        The summary of these genes is that they are all associated with either an
        ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, an antioxidant enzyme, a hormone binding
        protein, a nuclear receptor transcription factor, a fatty acid desaturase,
        a carnitine acyltransferase, an isocalate dehydrogenase, a peroxisomal membrane
        protein, or a flavin adenine dinecleotide (FAD)-dependent oxidoreductase.
        The most enriched terms are: ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, antioxidant
        enzyme, hormone binding protein, nuclear receptor transcription factor, fatty
        acid desaturase, carnitine acyltransferase, isocalate dehydrogenase, peroxisomal
        membrane protein, and FAD-dependent oxidoreductase.


        Mechanism: Many of the genes are involved in regulating the production and
        movement of lipids and fatty acids, as well as the synthesis of hormones,
        corticosteroids, and signalling receptors. The underlying biological mechanism
        is that these genes act as regulators of metabolic pathways, ensuring that
        their respective pathways are functioning correctly and that metabolites are

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.
