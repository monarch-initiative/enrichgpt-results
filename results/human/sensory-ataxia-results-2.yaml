        Hypothesis:  The enrichment of terms related to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
        and myelination suggest that these genes play an important role in peripheral
        nervous system development and maintenance, specifically in the formation
        and maintenance of myelin. The enrichment of terms related to protein folding
        and nucleic acid metabolism suggest that these genes also have a role in maintaining

        Here are the gene summaries:



        EGR2: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcription factor with three
        tandem C2H2-type zinc fingers. Defects in this gene are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
        disease type 1D (CMT1D), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4E (CMT4E), and
        with Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS). Multiple transcript variants encoding
        two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq,
        Oct 2008]


        NAGLU: This gene encodes an enzyme that degrades heparan sulfate by hydrolysis
        of terminal N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminides.
        Defects in this gene are the cause of mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS-IIIB),
        also known as Sanfilippo syndrome B. This disease is characterized by the
        lysosomal accumulation and urinary excretion of heparan sulfate. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        GPI: This gene encodes a member of the glucose phosphate isomerase protein
        family. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein
        based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. In the
        cytoplasm, the gene product functions as a glycolytic enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate
        isomerase) that interconverts glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.
        Extracellularly, the encoded protein (also referred to as neuroleukin) functions
        as a neurotrophic factor that promotes survival of skeletal motor neurons
        and sensory neurons, and as a lymphokine that induces immunoglobulin secretion.
        The encoded protein is also referred to as autocrine motility factor based
        on an additional function as a tumor-secreted cytokine and angiogenic factor.
        Defects in this gene are the cause of nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and
        a severe enzyme deficiency can be associated with hydrops fetalis, immediate
        neonatal death and neurological impairment. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2016]


        DNAJC3: This gene encodes a protein with multiple tetratricopeptide repeat
        (TPR) motifs as well as the highly conserved J domain found in DNAJ chaperone
        family members. It is a member of the tetratricopeptide repeat family of proteins
        and acts as an inhibitor of the interferon-induced, dsRNA-activated protein
        kinase (PKR). [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2010]


        SH3TC2: This gene encodes a protein with two N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3)
        domains and 10 tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, and is a member of a
        small gene family. The gene product has been proposed to be an adapter or
        docking molecule. Mutations in this gene result in autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth
        disease type 4C, a childhood-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized
        by demyelination of motor and sensory neurons. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        TWNK: This gene encodes a hexameric DNA helicase which unwinds short stretches
        of double-stranded DNA in the 5'' to 3'' direction and, along with mitochondrial
        single-stranded DNA binding protein and mtDNA polymerase gamma, is thought
        to play a key role in mtDNA replication. The protein localizes to the mitochondrial
        matrix and mitochondrial nucleoids. Mutations in this gene cause infantile
        onset spinocerebellar ataxia (IOSCA) and progressive external ophthalmoplegia
        (PEO) and are also associated with several mitochondrial depletion syndromes.
        Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct
        isoforms.[provided by RefSeq, Aug 2009]


        PIEZO2: The protein encoded by this gene contains more than thirty transmembrane
        domains and likely functions as part of mechanically-activated (MA) cation
        channels. These channels serve to connect mechanical forces to biological
        signals. The encoded protein quickly adapts MA currents in somatosensory neurons.
        Defects in this gene are a cause of type 5 distal arthrogryposis. Several
        alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described,
        but their full-length nature is not known. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        FLVCR1: This gene encodes a member of the major facilitator superfamily of
        transporter proteins. The encoded protein is a heme transporter that may play
        a critical role in erythropoiesis by protecting developing erythroid cells
        from heme toxicity. This gene may play a role in posterior column ataxia with
        retinitis pigmentosa and the hematological disorder Diamond-Blackfan syndrome.
        [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2011]


        MPZ: This gene is specifically expressed in Schwann cells of the peripheral
        nervous system and encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is a major
        structural protein of the peripheral myelin sheath. The encoded protein contains
        a large hydrophobic extracellular domain and a smaller basic intracellular
        domain, which are essential for the formation and stabilization of the multilamellar
        structure of the compact myelin. Mutations in this gene are associated with
        autosomal dominant form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1B) and
        other polyneuropathies, such as Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS) and congenital
        hypomyelinating neuropathy (CHN). A recent study showed that two isoforms
        are produced from the same mRNA by use of alternative in-frame translation
        termination codons via a stop codon readthrough mechanism. [provided by RefSeq,
        Oct 2015]


        PRX: This gene encodes a protein involved in peripheral nerve myelin upkeep.
        The encoded protein contains 2 PDZ domains which were named after PSD95 (post
        synaptic density protein), DlgA (Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor),
        and ZO1 (a mammalian tight junction protein). Two alternatively spliced transcript
        variants have been described for this gene which encode different protein
        isoforms and which are targeted differently in the Schwann cell. Mutations
        in this gene cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuoropathy, type 4F and Dejerine-Sottas
        neuropathy. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PMP22: This gene encodes an integral membrane protein that is a major component
        of myelin in the peripheral nervous system. Studies suggest two alternately
        used promoters drive tissue-specific expression. Various mutations of this
        gene are causes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Type IA, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome,
        and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul
        2013]


        KPNA3: The transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in
        eukaryotic cells is mediated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which consists
        of 60-100 proteins. Small molecules (up to 70 kD) can pass through the nuclear
        pore by nonselective diffusion while larger molecules are transported by an
        active process. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the importin alpha
        family, and is involved in nuclear protein import. [provided by RefSeq, Jan
        2009]


        POLG: Mitochondrial DNA polymerase is heterotrimeric, consisting of a homodimer
        of accessory subunits plus a catalytic subunit. The protein encoded by this
        gene is the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase. The encoded
        protein contains a polyglutamine tract near its N-terminus that may be polymorphic.
        Defects in this gene are a cause of progressive external ophthalmoplegia with
        mitochondrial DNA deletions 1 (PEOA1), sensory ataxic neuropathy dysarthria
        and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO), Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS), and mitochondrial
        neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome (MNGIE). Two transcript variants
        encoding the same protein have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq,
        Jul 2008]


        RNF170: This gene encodes a RING domain-containing protein that resides in
        the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin
        ligase and mediates ubiquitination and processing of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
        (IP3) receptors via the ER-associated protein degradation pathway. It is recruited
        to the activated IP3 receptors by the ERLIN1/ERLIN2 complex to which it is
        constitutively bound. Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal
        dominant sensory ataxia. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been
        found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2012]


        AARS1: The human alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) belongs to a family of tRNA
        synthases, of the class II enzymes.  Class II tRNA synthases evolved early
        in evolution and are highly conserved.  This is reflected by the fact that
        498 of the 968-residue polypeptide human AARS shares 41% identity witht the
        E.coli protein.  tRNA synthases are the enzymes that interpret the RNA code
        and attach specific aminoacids to the tRNAs that contain the cognate trinucleotide
        anticodons.  They consist of a catalytic domain which interacts with the amino
        acid acceptor-T psi C helix of the tRNA, and a second domain which interacts
        with the rest of the tRNA structure. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        synthases, of the class II enzymes.  Class II tRNA synthases evolved early
        in evolution and are highly conserved.  This is reflected by the fact that
        498 of the 968-residue polypeptide human AARS shares 41% identity witht the
        E.coli protein.  tRNA synthases are the enzymes that interpret the RNA code
        and attach specific aminoacids to the tRNAs that contain the cognate trinucleotide
        anticodons.  They consist of a catalytic domain which interacts with the amino
        acid acceptor-T psi C helix of the tRNA, and a second domain which interacts
        with the rest of the tRNA structure. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        EGR2: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcription factor with three
        tandem C2H2-type zinc fingers. Defects in this gene are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
        disease type 1D (CMT1D), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4E (CMT4E), and
        with Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS). Multiple transcript variants encoding
        two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq,
        Oct 2008]


        NAGLU: This gene encodes an enzyme that degrades heparan sulfate by hydrolysis
        of terminal N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminides.
        Defects in this gene are the cause of mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS-IIIB),
        also known as Sanfilippo syndrome B. This disease is characterized by the
        lysosomal accumulation and urinary excretion of heparan sulfate. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        GPI: This gene encodes a member of the glucose phosphate isomerase protein
        family. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein
        based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. In the
        cytoplasm, the gene product functions as a glycolytic enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate
        isomerase) that interconverts glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.
        Extracellularly, the encoded protein (also referred to as neuroleukin) functions
        as a neurotrophic factor that promotes survival of skeletal motor neurons
        and sensory neurons, and as a lymphokine that induces immunoglobulin secretion.
        The encoded protein is also referred to as autocrine motility factor based
        on an additional function as a tumor-secreted cytokine and angiogenic factor.
        Defects in this gene are the cause of nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and
        a severe enzyme deficiency can be associated with hydrops fetalis, immediate
        neonatal death and neurological impairment. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2016]


        DNAJC3: This gene encodes a protein with multiple tetratricopeptide repeat
        (TPR) motifs as well as the highly conserved J domain found in DNAJ chaperone
        family members. It is a member of the tetratricopeptide repeat family of proteins
        and acts as an inhibitor of the interferon-induced, dsRNA-activated protein
        kinase (PKR). [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2010]


        SH3TC2: This gene encodes a protein with two N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3)
        domains and 10 tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, and is a member of a
        small gene family. The gene product has been proposed to be an adapter or
        docking molecule. Mutations in this gene result in autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth
        disease type 4C, a childhood-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized
        by demyelination of motor and sensory neurons. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        TWNK: This gene encodes a hexameric DNA helicase which unwinds short stretches
        of double-stranded DNA in the 5'' to 3'' direction and, along with mitochondrial
        single-stranded DNA binding protein and mtDNA polymerase gamma, is thought
        to play a key role in mtDNA replication. The protein localizes to the mitochondrial
        matrix and mitochondrial nucleoids. Mutations in this gene cause infantile
        onset spinocerebellar ataxia (IOSCA) and progressive external ophthalmoplegia
        (PEO) and are also associated with several mitochondrial depletion syndromes.
        Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct
        isoforms.[provided by RefSeq, Aug 2009]


        PIEZO2: The protein encoded by this gene contains more than thirty transmembrane
        domains and likely functions as part of mechanically-activated (MA) cation
        channels. These channels serve to connect mechanical forces to biological
        signals. The encoded protein quickly adapts MA currents in somatosensory neurons.
        Defects in this gene are a cause of type 5 distal arthrogryposis. Several
        alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described,
        but their full-length nature is not known. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        FLVCR1: This gene encodes a member of the major facilitator superfamily of
        transporter proteins. The encoded protein is a heme transporter that may play
        a critical role in erythropoiesis by protecting developing erythroid cells
        from heme toxicity. This gene may play a role in posterior column ataxia with
        retinitis pigmentosa and the hematological disorder Diamond-Blackfan syndrome.
        [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2011]


        MPZ: This gene is specifically expressed in Schwann cells of the peripheral
        nervous system and encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is a major
        structural protein of the peripheral myelin sheath. The encoded protein contains
        a large hydrophobic extracellular domain and a smaller basic intracellular
        domain, which are essential for the formation and stabilization of the multilamellar
        structure of the compact myelin. Mutations in this gene are associated with
        autosomal dominant form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1B) and
        other polyneuropathies, such as Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS) and congenital
        hypomyelinating neuropathy (CHN). A recent study showed that two isoforms
        are produced from the same mRNA by use of alternative in-frame translation
        termination codons via a stop codon readthrough mechanism. [provided by RefSeq,
        Oct 2015]


        PRX: This gene encodes a protein involved in peripheral nerve myelin upkeep.
        The encoded protein contains 2 PDZ domains which were named after PSD95 (post
        synaptic density protein), DlgA (Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor),
        and ZO1 (a mammalian tight junction protein). Two alternatively spliced transcript
        variants have been described for this gene which encode different protein
        isoforms and which are targeted differently in the Schwann cell. Mutations
        in this gene cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuoropathy, type 4F and Dejerine-Sottas
        neuropathy. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PMP22: This gene encodes an integral membrane protein that is a major component
        of myelin in the peripheral nervous system. Studies suggest two alternately
        used promoters drive tissue-specific expression. Various mutations of this
        gene are causes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Type IA, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome,
        and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul
        2013]


        KPNA3: The transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in
        eukaryotic cells is mediated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which consists
        of 60-100 proteins. Small molecules (up to 70 kD) can pass through the nuclear
        pore by nonselective diffusion while larger molecules are transported by an
        active process. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the importin alpha
        family, and is involved in nuclear protein import. [provided by RefSeq, Jan
        2009]


        POLG: Mitochondrial DNA polymerase is heterotrimeric, consisting of a homodimer
        of accessory subunits plus a catalytic subunit. The protein encoded by this
        gene is the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase. The encoded
        protein contains a polyglutamine tract near its N-terminus that may be polymorphic.
        Defects in this gene are a cause of progressive external ophthalmoplegia with
        mitochondrial DNA deletions 1 (PEOA1), sensory ataxic neuropathy dysarthria
        and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO), Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS), and mitochondrial
        neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome (MNGIE). Two transcript variants
        encoding the same protein have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq,
        Jul 2008]


        RNF170: This gene encodes a RING domain-containing protein that resides in
        the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin
        ligase and mediates ubiquitination and processing of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
        (IP3) receptors via the ER-associated protein degradation pathway. It is recruited
        to the activated IP3 receptors by the ERLIN1/ERLIN2 complex to which it is
        constitutively bound. Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal
        dominant sensory ataxia. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been
        found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2012]


        AARS1: The human alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) belongs to a family of tRNA
        synthases, of the class II enzymes.  Class II tRNA synthases evolved early
        in evolution and are highly conserved.  This is reflected by the fact that
        498 of the 968-residue polypeptide human AARS shares 41% identity witht the
        E.coli protein.  tRNA synthases are the enzymes that interpret the RNA code
        and attach specific aminoacids to the tRNAs that contain the cognate trinucleotide
        anticodons.  They consist of a catalytic domain which interacts with the amino
        acid acceptor-T psi C helix of the tRNA, and a second domain which interacts
        with the rest of the tRNA structure. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        used promoters drive tissue-specific expression. Various mutations of this
        gene are causes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Type IA, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome,
        and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul

        KPNA3: The transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in
        eukaryotic cells is mediated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which consists
        of 60-100 proteins. Small molecules (up to 70 kD) can pass through the nuclear
        pore by nonselective diffusion while larger molecules are transported by an
        active process. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the importin alpha
        family, and is involved in nuclear protein import. [provided by RefSeq, Jan

        POLG: Mitochondrial DNA polymerase is heterotrimeric, consisting of a homodimer
        of accessory subunits plus a catalytic subunit. The protein encoded by this
        gene is the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase. The encoded
        protein contains a polyglutamine tract near its N-terminus that may be polymorphic.
        Defects in this gene are a cause of progressive external ophthalmoplegia with
        mitochondrial DNA deletions 1 (PEOA1), sensory ataxic neuropathy dysarthria
        and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO), Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS), and mitochondrial
        neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome (MNGIE). Two transcript variants
        encoding the same protein have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq,
        Jul 2008]


        RNF170: This gene encodes a RING domain-containing protein that resides in
        the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin
        ligase and mediates ubiquitination and processing of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
        (IP3) receptors via the ER-associated protein degradation pathway. It is recruited
        to the activated IP3 receptors by the ERLIN1/ERLIN2 complex to which it is
        constitutively bound. Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal
        dominant sensory ataxia. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been
        found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2012]


        AARS1: The human alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) belongs to a family of tRNA
        synthases, of the class II enzymes.  Class II tRNA synthases evolved early
        in evolution and are highly conserved.  This is reflected by the fact that
        498 of the 968-residue polypeptide human AARS shares 41% identity witht the
        E.coli protein.  tRNA synthases are the enzymes that interpret the RNA code
        and attach specific aminoacids to the tRNAs that contain the cognate trinucleotide
        anticodons.  They consist of a catalytic domain which interacts with the amino
        acid acceptor-T psi C helix of the tRNA, and a second domain which interacts
        with the rest of the tRNA structure. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        EGR2: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcription factor with three
        tandem C2H2-type zinc fingers. Defects in this gene are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
        disease type 1D (CMT1D), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4E (CMT4E), and
        with Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS). Multiple transcript variants encoding
        two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq,
        Oct 2008]


        TWNK: This gene encodes a hexameric DNA helicase which unwinds short stretches
        of double-stranded DNA in the 5'' to 3'' direction and, along with mitochondrial
        single-stranded DNA binding protein and mtDNA polymerase gamma, is thought
        to play a key role in mtDNA replication. The protein localizes to the mitochondrial
        matrix and mitochondrial nucleoids. Mutations in this gene cause infantile
        onset spinocerebellar ataxia (IOSCA) and progressive external ophthalmoplegia
        (PEO) and are also associated with several mitochondrial depletion syndromes.
        Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct
        isoforms.[provided by RefSeq, Aug 2009]


        NAGLU: This gene encodes an enzyme that degrades heparan sulfate by hydrolysis
        of terminal N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminides.
        Defects in this gene are the cause of mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS-IIIB),
        also known as Sanfilippo syndrome B. This disease is characterized by the
        lysosomal accumulation and urinary excretion of heparan sulfate. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PMP22: This gene encodes an integral membrane protein that is a major component
        of myelin in the peripheral nervous system. Studies suggest two alternately
        used promoters drive tissue-specific expression. Various mutations of this
        gene are causes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Type IA, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome,
        and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul
        2013]


        PIEZO2: The protein encoded by this gene contains more than thirty transmembrane
        domains and likely functions as part of mechanically-activated (MA) cation
        channels. These channels serve to connect mechanical forces to biological
        signals. The encoded protein quickly adapts MA currents in somatosensory neurons.
        Defects in this gene are a cause of type 5 distal arthrogryposis. Several
        alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described,
        but their full-length nature is not known. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        PRX: This gene encodes a protein involved in peripheral nerve myelin upkeep.
        The encoded protein contains 2 PDZ domains which were named after PSD95 (post
        synaptic density protein), DlgA (Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor),
        and ZO1 (a mammalian tight junction protein). Two alternatively spliced transcript
        variants have been described for this gene which encode different protein
        isoforms and which are targeted differently in the Schwann cell. Mutations
        in this gene cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuoropathy, type 4F and Dejerine-Sottas
        neuropathy. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        GPI: This gene encodes a member of the glucose phosphate isomerase protein
        family. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein
        based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. In the
        cytoplasm, the gene product functions as a glycolytic enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate
        isomerase) that interconverts glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.
        Extracellularly, the encoded protein (also referred to as neuroleukin) functions
        as a neurotrophic factor that promotes survival of skeletal motor neurons
        and sensory neurons, and as a lymphokine that induces immunoglobulin secretion.
        The encoded protein is also referred to as autocrine motility factor based
        on an additional function as a tumor-secreted cytokine and angiogenic factor.
        Defects in this gene are the cause of nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and
        a severe enzyme deficiency can be associated with hydrops fetalis, immediate
        neonatal death and neurological impairment. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2016]


        AARS1: The human alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) belongs to a family of tRNA
        synthases, of the class II enzymes.  Class II tRNA synthases evolved early
        in evolution and are highly conserved.  This is reflected by the fact that
        498 of the 968-residue polypeptide human AARS shares 41% identity witht the
        E.coli protein.  tRNA synthases are the enzymes that interpret the RNA code
        and attach specific aminoacids to the tRNAs that contain the cognate trinucleotide
        anticodons.  They consist of a catalytic domain which interacts with the amino
        acid acceptor-T psi C helix of the tRNA, and a second domain which interacts
        with the rest of the tRNA structure. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FLVCR1: This gene encodes a member of the major facilitator superfamily of
        transporter proteins. The encoded protein is a heme transporter that may play
        a critical role in erythropoiesis by protecting developing erythroid cells
        from heme toxicity. This gene may play a role in posterior column ataxia with
        retinitis pigmentosa and the hematological disorder Diamond-Blackfan syndrome.
        [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2011]


        POLG: Mitochondrial DNA polymerase is heterotrimeric, consisting of a homodimer
        of accessory subunits plus a catalytic subunit. The protein encoded by this
        gene is the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase. The encoded
        protein contains a polyglutamine tract near its N-terminus that may be polymorphic.
        Defects in this gene are a cause of progressive external ophthalmoplegia with
        mitochondrial DNA deletions 1 (PEOA1), sensory ataxic neuropathy dysarthria
        and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO), Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS), and mitochondrial
        neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome (MNGIE). Two transcript variants
        encoding the same protein have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq,
        Jul 2008]


        KPNA3: The transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in
        eukaryotic cells is mediated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which consists
        of 60-100 proteins. Small molecules (up to 70 kD) can pass through the nuclear
        pore by nonselective diffusion while larger molecules are transported by an
        active process. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the importin alpha
        family, and is involved in nuclear protein import. [provided by RefSeq, Jan
        2009]


        DNAJC3: This gene encodes a protein with multiple tetratricopeptide repeat
        (TPR) motifs as well as the highly conserved J domain found in DNAJ chaperone
        family members. It is a member of the tetratricopeptide repeat family of proteins
        and acts as an inhibitor of the interferon-induced, dsRNA-activated protein
        kinase (PKR). [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2010]


        RNF170: This gene encodes a RING domain-containing protein that resides in
        the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin
        ligase and mediates ubiquitination and processing of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
        (IP3) receptors via the ER-associated protein degradation pathway. It is recruited
        to the activated IP3 receptors by the ERLIN1/ERLIN2 complex to which it is
        constitutively bound. Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal
        dominant sensory ataxia. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been
        found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2012]


        MPZ: This gene is specifically expressed in Schwann cells of the peripheral
        nervous system and encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is a major
        structural protein of the peripheral myelin sheath. The encoded protein contains
        a large hydrophobic extracellular domain and a smaller basic intracellular
        domain, which are essential for the formation and stabilization of the multilamellar
        structure of the compact myelin. Mutations in this gene are associated with
        autosomal dominant form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1B) and

        Here are the gene summaries:



        EGR2: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcription factor with three
        tandem C2H2-type zinc fingers. Defects in this gene are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
        disease type 1D (CMT1D), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4E (CMT4E), and
        with Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS). Multiple transcript variants encoding
        two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq,
        Oct 2008]


        TWNK: This gene encodes a hexameric DNA helicase which unwinds short stretches
        of double-stranded DNA in the 5'' to 3'' direction and, along with mitochondrial
        single-stranded DNA binding protein and mtDNA polymerase gamma, is thought
        to play a key role in mtDNA replication. The protein localizes to the mitochondrial
        matrix and mitochondrial nucleoids. Mutations in this gene cause infantile
        onset spinocerebellar ataxia (IOSCA) and progressive external ophthalmoplegia
        (PEO) and are also associated with several mitochondrial depletion syndromes.
        Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct
        isoforms.[provided by RefSeq, Aug 2009]


        NAGLU: This gene encodes an enzyme that degrades heparan sulfate by hydrolysis
        of terminal N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminides.
        Defects in this gene are the cause of mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS-IIIB),
        also known as Sanfilippo syndrome B. This disease is characterized by the
        lysosomal accumulation and urinary excretion of heparan sulfate. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PMP22: This gene encodes an integral membrane protein that is a major component
        of myelin in the peripheral nervous system. Studies suggest two alternately
        used promoters drive tissue-specific expression. Various mutations of this
        gene are causes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Type IA, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome,
        and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul
        2013]


        PIEZO2: The protein encoded by this gene contains more than thirty transmembrane
        domains and likely functions as part of mechanically-activated (MA) cation
        channels. These channels serve to connect mechanical forces to biological
        signals. The encoded protein quickly adapts MA currents in somatosensory neurons.
        Defects in this gene are a cause of type 5 distal arthrogryposis. Several
        alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described,
        but their full-length nature is not known. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        PRX: This gene encodes a protein involved in peripheral nerve myelin upkeep.
        The encoded protein contains 2 PDZ domains which were named after PSD95 (post
        synaptic density protein), DlgA (Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor),
        and ZO1 (a mammalian tight junction protein). Two alternatively spliced transcript
        variants have been described for this gene which encode different protein
        isoforms and which are targeted differently in the Schwann cell. Mutations
        in this gene cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuoropathy, type 4F and Dejerine-Sottas
        neuropathy. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        GPI: This gene encodes a member of the glucose phosphate isomerase protein
        family. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein
        based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. In the
        cytoplasm, the gene product functions as a glycolytic enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate
        isomerase) that interconverts glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.
        Extracellularly, the encoded protein (also referred to as neuroleukin) functions
        as a neurotrophic factor that promotes survival of skeletal motor neurons
        and sensory neurons, and as a lymphokine that induces immunoglobulin secretion.
        The encoded protein is also referred to as autocrine motility factor based
        on an additional function as a tumor-secreted cytokine and angiogenic factor.
        Defects in this gene are the cause of nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and
        a severe enzyme deficiency can be associated with hydrops fetalis, immediate
        neonatal death and neurological impairment. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2016]


        AARS1: The human alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) belongs to a family of tRNA
        synthases, of the class II enzymes.  Class II tRNA synthases evolved early
        in evolution and are highly conserved.  This is reflected by the fact that
        498 of the 968-residue polypeptide human AARS shares 41% identity witht the
        E.coli protein.  tRNA synthases are the enzymes that interpret the RNA code
        and attach specific aminoacids to the tRNAs that contain the cognate trinucleotide
        anticodons.  They consist of a catalytic domain which interacts with the amino
        acid acceptor-T psi C helix of the tRNA, and a second domain which interacts
        with the rest of the tRNA structure. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FLVCR1: This gene encodes a member of the major facilitator superfamily of
        transporter proteins. The encoded protein is a heme transporter that may play
        a critical role in erythropoiesis by protecting developing erythroid cells
        from heme toxicity. This gene may play a role in posterior column ataxia with
        retinitis pigmentosa and the hematological disorder Diamond-Blackfan syndrome.
        [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2011]


        POLG: Mitochondrial DNA polymerase is heterotrimeric, consisting of a homodimer
        of accessory subunits plus a catalytic subunit. The protein encoded by this
        gene is the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase. The encoded
        protein contains a polyglutamine tract near its N-terminus that may be polymorphic.
        Defects in this gene are a cause of progressive external ophthalmoplegia with
        mitochondrial DNA deletions 1 (PEOA1), sensory ataxic neuropathy dysarthria
        and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO), Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS), and mitochondrial
        neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome (MNGIE). Two transcript variants
        encoding the same protein have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq,
        Jul 2008]


        KPNA3: The transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in
        eukaryotic cells is mediated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which consists
        of 60-100 proteins. Small molecules (up to 70 kD) can pass through the nuclear
        pore by nonselective diffusion while larger molecules are transported by an
        active process. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the importin alpha
        family, and is involved in nuclear protein import. [provided by RefSeq, Jan
        2009]


        DNAJC3: This gene encodes a protein with multiple tetratricopeptide repeat
        (TPR) motifs as well as the highly conserved J domain found in DNAJ chaperone
        family members. It is a member of the tetratricopeptide repeat family of proteins
        and acts as an inhibitor of the interferon-induced, dsRNA-activated protein
        kinase (PKR). [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2010]


        RNF170: This gene encodes a RING domain-containing protein that resides in
        the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin
        ligase and mediates ubiquitination and processing of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
        (IP3) receptors via the ER-associated protein degradation pathway. It is recruited
        to the activated IP3 receptors by the ERLIN1/ERLIN2 complex to which it is
        constitutively bound. Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal
        dominant sensory ataxia. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been
        found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2012]


        MPZ: This gene is specifically expressed in Schwann cells of the peripheral
        nervous system and encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is a major
        structural protein of the peripheral myelin sheath. The encoded protein contains
        a large hydrophobic extracellular domain and a smaller basic intracellular
        domain, which are essential for the formation and stabilization of the multilamellar
        structure of the compact myelin. Mutations in this gene are associated with
        autosomal dominant form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1B) and
        other polyneuropathies, such as Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS) and congenital
        hypomyelinating neuropathy (CHN). A recent study showed that two isoforms
        are produced from the same mRNA by use of alternative in-frame translation
        termination codons via a stop codon readthrough mechanism. [provided by RefSeq,

        Here are the gene summaries:



        EGR2: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcription factor with three
        tandem C2H2-type zinc fingers. Defects in this gene are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
        disease type 1D (CMT1D), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4E (CMT4E), and
        with Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS). Multiple transcript variants encoding
        two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq,
        Oct 2008]


        TWNK: This gene encodes a hexameric DNA helicase which unwinds short stretches
        of double-stranded DNA in the 5'' to 3'' direction and, along with mitochondrial
        single-stranded DNA binding protein and mtDNA polymerase gamma, is thought
        to play a key role in mtDNA replication. The protein localizes to the mitochondrial
        matrix and mitochondrial nucleoids. Mutations in this gene cause infantile
        onset spinocerebellar ataxia (IOSCA) and progressive external ophthalmoplegia
        (PEO) and are also associated with several mitochondrial depletion syndromes.
        Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct
        isoforms.[provided by RefSeq, Aug 2009]


        NAGLU: This gene encodes an enzyme that degrades heparan sulfate by hydrolysis
        of terminal N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminides.
        Defects in this gene are the cause of mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS-IIIB),
        also known as Sanfilippo syndrome B. This disease is characterized by the
        lysosomal accumulation and urinary excretion of heparan sulfate. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PMP22: This gene encodes an integral membrane protein that is a major component
        of myelin in the peripheral nervous system. Studies suggest two alternately
        used promoters drive tissue-specific expression. Various mutations of this
        gene are causes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Type IA, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome,
        and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul
        2013]


        PIEZO2: The protein encoded by this gene contains more than thirty transmembrane
        domains and likely functions as part of mechanically-activated (MA) cation
        channels. These channels serve to connect mechanical forces to biological
        signals. The encoded protein quickly adapts MA currents in somatosensory neurons.
        Defects in this gene are a cause of type 5 distal arthrogryposis. Several
        alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described,
        but their full-length nature is not known. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        PRX: This gene encodes a protein involved in peripheral nerve myelin upkeep.
        The encoded protein contains 2 PDZ domains which were named after PSD95 (post
        synaptic density protein), DlgA (Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor),
        and ZO1 (a mammalian tight junction protein). Two alternatively spliced transcript
        variants have been described for this gene which encode different protein
        isoforms and which are targeted differently in the Schwann cell. Mutations
        in this gene cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuoropathy, type 4F and Dejerine-Sottas
        neuropathy. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        GPI: This gene encodes a member of the glucose phosphate isomerase protein
        family. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein
        based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. In the
        cytoplasm, the gene product functions as a glycolytic enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate
        isomerase) that interconverts glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.
        Extracellularly, the encoded protein (also referred to as neuroleukin) functions
        as a neurotrophic factor that promotes survival of skeletal motor neurons
        and sensory neurons, and as a lymphokine that induces immunoglobulin secretion.
        The encoded protein is also referred to as autocrine motility factor based
        on an additional function as a tumor-secreted cytokine and angiogenic factor.
        Defects in this gene are the cause of nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and
        a severe enzyme deficiency can be associated with hydrops fetalis, immediate
        neonatal death and neurological impairment. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2016]


        AARS1: The human alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) belongs to a family of tRNA
        synthases, of the class II enzymes.  Class II tRNA synthases evolved early
        in evolution and are highly conserved.  This is reflected by the fact that
        498 of the 968-residue polypeptide human AARS shares 41% identity witht the
        E.coli protein.  tRNA synthases are the enzymes that interpret the RNA code
        and attach specific aminoacids to the tRNAs that contain the cognate trinucleotide
        anticodons.  They consist of a catalytic domain which interacts with the amino
        acid acceptor-T psi C helix of the tRNA, and a second domain which interacts
        with the rest of the tRNA structure. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FLVCR1: This gene encodes a member of the major facilitator superfamily of
        transporter proteins. The encoded protein is a heme transporter that may play
        a critical role in erythropoiesis by protecting developing erythroid cells
        from heme toxicity. This gene may play a role in posterior column ataxia with
        retinitis pigmentosa and the hematological disorder Diamond-Blackfan syndrome.
        [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2011]


        POLG: Mitochondrial DNA polymerase is heterotrimeric, consisting of a homodimer
        of accessory subunits plus a catalytic subunit. The protein encoded by this
        gene is the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase. The encoded
        protein contains a polyglutamine tract near its N-terminus that may be polymorphic.
        Defects in this gene are a cause of progressive external ophthalmoplegia with
        mitochondrial DNA deletions 1 (PEOA1), sensory ataxic neuropathy dysarthria
        and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO), Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS), and mitochondrial
        neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome (MNGIE). Two transcript variants
        encoding the same protein have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq,
        Jul 2008]


        KPNA3: The transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in
        eukaryotic cells is mediated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which consists
        of 60-100 proteins. Small molecules (up to 70 kD) can pass through the nuclear
        pore by nonselective diffusion while larger molecules are transported by an
        active process. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the importin alpha
        family, and is involved in nuclear protein import. [provided by RefSeq, Jan
        2009]


        DNAJC3: This gene encodes a protein with multiple tetratricopeptide repeat
        (TPR) motifs as well as the highly conserved J domain found in DNAJ chaperone
        family members. It is a member of the tetratricopeptide repeat family of proteins
        and acts as an inhibitor of the interferon-induced, dsRNA-activated protein
        kinase (PKR). [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2010]


        RNF170: This gene encodes a RING domain-containing protein that resides in
        the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin
        ligase and mediates ubiquitination and processing of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
        (IP3) receptors via the ER-associated protein degradation pathway. It is recruited
        to the activated IP3 receptors by the ERLIN1/ERLIN2 complex to which it is
        constitutively bound. Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal
        dominant sensory ataxia. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been
        found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2012]


        MPZ: This gene is specifically expressed in Schwann cells of the peripheral
        nervous system and encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is a major
        structural protein of the peripheral myelin sheath. The encoded protein contains
        a large hydrophobic extracellular domain and a smaller basic intracellular
        domain, which are essential for the formation and stabilization of the multilamellar
        structure of the compact myelin. Mutations in this gene are associated with
        autosomal dominant form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1B) and
        other polyneuropathies, such as Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS) and congenital
        hypomyelinating neuropathy (CHN). A recent study showed that two isoforms
        are produced from the same mRNA by use of alternative in-frame translation
        termination codons via a stop codon readthrough mechanism. [provided by RefSeq,

        Here are the gene summaries:



        EGR2: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcription factor with three
        tandem C2H2-type zinc fingers. Defects in this gene are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
        disease type 1D (CMT1D), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4E (CMT4E), and
        with Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS). Multiple transcript variants encoding
        two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq,
        Oct 2008]


        TWNK: This gene encodes a hexameric DNA helicase which unwinds short stretches
        of double-stranded DNA in the 5'' to 3'' direction and, along with mitochondrial
        single-stranded DNA binding protein and mtDNA polymerase gamma, is thought
        to play a key role in mtDNA replication. The protein localizes to the mitochondrial
        matrix and mitochondrial nucleoids. Mutations in this gene cause infantile
        onset spinocerebellar ataxia (IOSCA) and progressive external ophthalmoplegia
        (PEO) and are also associated with several mitochondrial depletion syndromes.
        Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct
        isoforms.[provided by RefSeq, Aug 2009]


        NAGLU: This gene encodes an enzyme that degrades heparan sulfate by hydrolysis
        of terminal N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminides.
        Defects in this gene are the cause of mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS-IIIB),
        also known as Sanfilippo syndrome B. This disease is characterized by the
        lysosomal accumulation and urinary excretion of heparan sulfate. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PMP22: This gene encodes an integral membrane protein that is a major component
        of myelin in the peripheral nervous system. Studies suggest two alternately
        used promoters drive tissue-specific expression. Various mutations of this
        gene are causes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Type IA, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome,
        and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul
        2013]


        PIEZO2: The protein encoded by this gene contains more than thirty transmembrane
        domains and likely functions as part of mechanically-activated (MA) cation
        channels. These channels serve to connect mechanical forces to biological
        signals. The encoded protein quickly adapts MA currents in somatosensory neurons.
        Defects in this gene are a cause of type 5 distal arthrogryposis. Several
        alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described,
        but their full-length nature is not known. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        PRX: This gene encodes a protein involved in peripheral nerve myelin upkeep.
        The encoded protein contains 2 PDZ domains which were named after PSD95 (post
        synaptic density protein), DlgA (Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor),
        and ZO1 (a mammalian tight junction protein). Two alternatively spliced transcript
        variants have been described for this gene which encode different protein
        isoforms and which are targeted differently in the Schwann cell. Mutations
        in this gene cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuoropathy, type 4F and Dejerine-Sottas
        neuropathy. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        GPI: This gene encodes a member of the glucose phosphate isomerase protein
        family. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein
        based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. In the
        cytoplasm, the gene product functions as a glycolytic enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate
        isomerase) that interconverts glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.
        Extracellularly, the encoded protein (also referred to as neuroleukin) functions
        as a neurotrophic factor that promotes survival of skeletal motor neurons
        and sensory neurons, and as a lymphokine that induces immunoglobulin secretion.
        The encoded protein is also referred to as autocrine motility factor based
        on an additional function as a tumor-secreted cytokine and angiogenic factor.
        Defects in this gene are the cause of nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and
        a severe enzyme deficiency can be associated with hydrops fetalis, immediate
        neonatal death and neurological impairment. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2016]


        AARS1: The human alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) belongs to a family of tRNA
        synthases, of the class II enzymes.  Class II tRNA synthases evolved early
        in evolution and are highly conserved.  This is reflected by the fact that
        498 of the 968-residue polypeptide human AARS shares 41% identity witht the
        E.coli protein.  tRNA synthases are the enzymes that interpret the RNA code
        and attach specific aminoacids to the tRNAs that contain the cognate trinucleotide
        anticodons.  They consist of a catalytic domain which interacts with the amino
        acid acceptor-T psi C helix of the tRNA, and a second domain which interacts
        with the rest of the tRNA structure. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FLVCR1: This gene encodes a member of the major facilitator superfamily of
        transporter proteins. The encoded protein is a heme transporter that may play
        a critical role in erythropoiesis by protecting developing erythroid cells
        from heme toxicity. This gene may play a role in posterior column ataxia with
        retinitis pigmentosa and the hematological disorder Diamond-Blackfan syndrome.
        [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2011]


        POLG: Mitochondrial DNA polymerase is heterotrimeric, consisting of a homodimer
        of accessory subunits plus a catalytic subunit. The protein encoded by this
        gene is the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase. The encoded
        protein contains a polyglutamine tract near its N-terminus that may be polymorphic.
        Defects in this gene are a cause of progressive external ophthalmoplegia with
        mitochondrial DNA deletions 1 (PEOA1), sensory ataxic neuropathy dysarthria
        and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO), Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS), and mitochondrial
        neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome (MNGIE). Two transcript variants
        encoding the same protein have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq,
        Jul 2008]


        KPNA3: The transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in
        eukaryotic cells is mediated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which consists
        of 60-100 proteins. Small molecules (up to 70 kD) can pass through the nuclear
        pore by nonselective diffusion while larger molecules are transported by an
        active process. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the importin alpha
        family, and is involved in nuclear protein import. [provided by RefSeq, Jan
        2009]


        DNAJC3: This gene encodes a protein with multiple tetratricopeptide repeat
        (TPR) motifs as well as the highly conserved J domain found in DNAJ chaperone
        family members. It is a member of the tetratricopeptide repeat family of proteins
        and acts as an inhibitor of the interferon-induced, dsRNA-activated protein
        kinase (PKR). [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2010]


        RNF170: This gene encodes a RING domain-containing protein that resides in
        the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin
