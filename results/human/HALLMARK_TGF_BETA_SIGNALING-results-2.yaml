        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Enriched Terms: signal transduction; regulation of gene expression; transcription
        regulation; protein phosphorylation; SMAD protein signal transduction.


        Mechanism: These genes are involved in various aspects of signal transduction,
        including regulation of gene expression, transcription regulation, and protein
        phosphorylation. The SMAD protein signal transduction pathway is a common
        underlying mechanism for many of these genes. SMAD proteins are intracellular
        signaling molecules that transmit signals from transforming growth factor-beta
        (TGF-beta) family ligands to the nucleus, where they regulate transcription
        of target genes. Genes in this list may activate or inhibit SMAD signaling
        and affect downstream transcriptional regulation. Additionally, many of these
        genes play roles in other signaling pathways and regulatory processes, such
        as the Wnt signaling pathway and negative regulation of protein degradation.'

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.
