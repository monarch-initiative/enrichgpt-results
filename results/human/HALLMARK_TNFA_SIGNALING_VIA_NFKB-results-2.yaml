        Enriched Terms: DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase
        II-specific; cytokine activity; protein binding activity.


        Mechanism: These genes are involved in the regulation of transcription and
        cytokine activity, likely playing a role in immune responses and cellular
        differentiation. They are involved in binding to DNA and RNA polymerases to
        regulate the expression of genes, as well as in the production and regulation
        of cytokines and growth factors that play a role in cell signaling and differentiation.


        Hypothesis: These genes may be involved in the regulation of immune responses,
        cellular differentiation, and tissue growth and repair. They may interact
        with signaling pathways involved in cytokine production and response, such
        as the JAK-STAT pathway and the NF-kappaB pathway.'

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.


        Provide results in the format

        Mechanism: <mechanism>

        For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number
        the list.

        Always put the list of terms last, after mechanism, summary, or hypotheses.

      response_text: 'Summary: Immune response and inflammation-related gene functions
        are enriched in the given list of genes.

        Enriched Terms: immune response; inflammation; regulation of TNF production;
        cytokine production; response to lipopolysaccharide; negative regulation of
        NF-kappaB transcription factor activity.


        Mechanism and Hypothesis: The enriched terms suggest that these genes play
        an important role in regulating the immune system response and controlling
        inflammation. This includes controlling cytokine and TNF production, which
        are important factors in regulating inflammation. The negative regulation
        of the NF-kappaB transcription factor activity may play a role in preventing
        inflammation and maintaining immune system homeostasis. These findings may
        have implications for understanding a range of inflammatory conditions and
        immune system disorders.'

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        enzyme binding activity; phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate binding activity;
        G protein-coupled receptor activity.


        Mechanism: The enriched terms suggest that the genes on the list are involved
        in signaling pathways that regulate gene expression and cellular responses
        through cytokine receptors, intracellular signaling cascades, and various
        enzymatic activities. These pathways play essential roles in several biological
        processes, including immune responses, cell differentiation and development,
        and cell survival and death.'

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.
