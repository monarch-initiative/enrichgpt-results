        mechanism: the enriched terms indicate the activation of the type i interferon
        signaling pathway, immune response, and antigen processing and presentation.
        type i interferons play a crucial role in protecting the host against viral
        infections by inducing an antiviral state in cells. the pathway is activated
        when a foreign pathogen is detected by pattern recognition receptors (prrs)
        that recognize conserved molecular structures commonly found in microbes'

        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Mechanism: The biological mechanism underlying the enriched terms is most
        likely associated with cell and immune response. These genes are involved
        in various processes related to cell signaling, detection, recognition, transcription,
        and expression. Through these processes, the genes regulate important functions
        such as cell adhesion, protein binding, enzyme binding, cytokine activity,
        and transcription factor activation. In addition, several of these genes are
        also involved in apoptotic and other cell regulation pathways.'

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        and inflammation.


        Mechanism: These genes are involved in pathways that regulate immune responses,
        such as the induction of cytokines, the recognition of viral DNA, the binding
        of RNA and DNA, the ubiquitination of proteins, and the activation of inflammatory
        pathways.

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Summary and enriched terms:'
      response_text: '

        The genes in the list encode proteins involved in a variety of processes including
        immunity, inflammation, transcription, signal transduction, and protein folding
        and assembly. These processes are typically carried out by two main classes
        of molecules; ubiquitin ligases and cytokines. The genes in this list are
        enriched for terms including "signal transduction", "ubiquitin ligases", "immune
        modulation", "cytokine activity", "transcription regulation", "proteasome
        activity", "RNA binding", and "metallothionein".


        Mechanism:

        The genes in this list encode proteins involved in a variety of processes,
        with an emphasis on immunity and inflammation. These processes are typically
        mediated by ubiquitin ligases, cytokines, and other signal transduction proteins.
        Ubiquitin ligases mark target proteins for ubiquitination and other modifications,
        while cytokines affect the activity of multiple cells. Signal transduction
        proteins transmit signals across cell membranes, affecting the activity of
        cells. Metallothioneins play a role in detoxification and protein folding
        and assembly, while proteasomes carry out protein degradation within the cell.
        Transcripts are regulated by transcription factors, and many genes contain
        RNA binding domains. '

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.
