        Here are the gene summaries:



        ABCC8: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of
        ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules
        across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven
        distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). This protein
        is a member of the MRP subfamily which is involved in multi-drug resistance.
        This protein functions as a modulator of ATP-sensitive potassium channels
        and insulin release. Mutations in the ABCC8 gene and deficiencies in the encoded
        protein have been observed in patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemi...


        AKT3: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the AKT, also called
        PKB,  serine/threonine protein kinase family. AKT kinases are known to be
        regulators of cell signaling in response to insulin and growth factors. They
        are involved in a wide variety of biological processes including cell proliferation,
        differentiation, apoptosis, tumorigenesis, as well as glycogen synthesis and
        glucose uptake. This kinase has bee...


        CHGA: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the chromogranin/secretogranin
        family of neuroendocrine secretory proteins. It is found in secretory vesicles
        of neurons and endocrine cells. This gene product is a precursor to three
        biologically active peptides; vasostatin, pancreastatin, and parastatin. These
        peptides act as autocrine or paracrine negative modulators of the neuroendocrine
        system. Tw...


        DCX: This gene encodes a member of the doublecortin family. The protein encoded
        by this gene is a cytoplasmic protein and contains two doublecortin domains,
        which bind microtubules. In the developing cortex, cortical neurons must migrate
        over long distances to reach the site of their final differentiation. The
        encoded protein appears to direct neuronal migration by regulating the organization
        and stability of microtubules. In addition, the encoded protein interacts
        with LIS1, the regulatory gamma subunit of platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase,
        and this interaction is important to proper microtubule function in the developing
        cortex. Mutations in this gene c...


        DPP4: The DPP4 gene encodes dipeptidyl peptidase 4, which is identical to
        adenosine deaminase complexing protein-2, and to the T-cell activation antigen
        CD26. It is an intrinsic type II transmembrane glycoprotein and a serine exopeptidase
        that cleaves X-proline dipeptides from the N-terminus of polypeptides. Dipeptidyl
        peptidase 4 is highly involved in glucose and insulin metabolism, as well
        as in immune regulation. This protein wa...


        ELP4: This gene encodes a component of the six subunit elongator complex,
        a histone acetyltransferase complex that associates directly with RNA polymerase
        II during transcriptional elongation. The human gene can partially complement
        sensitivity phenotypes of yeast ELP4 deletion muta...


        FOXA2: This gene encodes a member of the forkhead class of DNA-binding proteins.
        These hepatocyte nuclear factors are transcriptional activators for liver-specific
        genes such as albumin and transthyretin, and they also interact with chromatin.
        Similar family members in mice have roles in the regulation of metabolism
        and in the differentiation of the pancreas and li...


        FOXO1: This gene belongs to the forkhead family of transcription factors which
        are characterized by a distinct forkhead domain.  The specific function of

        trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway.
        The protein undergoes an initial autocatalytic processing event and interacts
        with a neuroendocrine secretory protein in the ER, exits the ER and sorts
        to secretory granules, where it is cleaved and catalytically activated during
        intracellular transport. The encoded protease is packaged into and activated
        in dense core secretory granules and expressed in the neuroendocrine system
        and brain. This gene encodes one of the seven basic amino acid-specific members
        which cleave their substrates at single or paired basic resi...


        PDX1: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional activator of several
        genes, including insulin, somatostatin, glucokinase, islet amyloid polypeptide,

        SLC2A2: This gene encodes an integral plasma membrane glycoprotein of the
        liver, islet beta cells, intestine, and kidney epithelium. The encoded protein
        mediates facilitated bidirectional glucose transport. Because of its low affinity
        for glucose, it has been suggested as a glucose sensor. Mutations in this
        gene are associated with susceptibility to dise...

        is a subunit of the signal recognition particle receptor (SR). This subunit
        is a transmembrane GTPase belonging to the GTPase superfamily. It anchors
        alpha subunit, a peripheral membrane GTPase, to the...


        SST: The hormone somatostatin has active 14 aa and 28 aa forms that are produced
        by alternate cleavage of the single preproprotein encoded by this gene. Somatostatin
        is expressed throughout the body and inhibits the release of numerous secondary
        hormones by binding to high-affinity G-protein-coupled somatostatin receptors.
        This hormone is an important regulator of the endocrine system through its
        interactions with pituitary growth hormone, ...


        STXBP1: This gene encodes a syntaxin-binding protein. The encoded protein

        Family members have an extracellular N-terminal transmembrane domain and a
        cytoplasmic C terminus with two tandem C2 domains (C2A and C2B). Synaptotogmin
        family members can form homo- and heteromeric complexes with each other. They
        also have different biochemical properties and developmental profiles, and
        patterns of tissue distributio...


        VDR: This gene encodes vitamin D3 receptor, which is a member of the nuclear
        hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors. This
        receptor also functions as a receptor for the secondary bile acid, lithocholic
        acid. Downstream targets of vitamin D3 receptor are principally involved in
        mineral metabolism, though this receptor regulates a variety of other metabolic
        pathways, such as those involved in immune response and cancer. Mutations
        in this gene are associated with type II vitamin D-resistant rickets. A single
        nucleotide polymorphism in the initiation codon results in an alternate translation
        start site three co...

        Here are the gene summaries:



        ABCC8: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of
        ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules
        across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven
        distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). This protein
        is a member of the MRP subfamily which is involved in multi-drug resistance.
        This protein functions as a modulator of ATP-sensitive potassium channels
        and insulin release. Mutations in the ABCC8 gene and deficiencies in the encoded
        protein have been observed in patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemi...


        AKT3: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the AKT, also called
        PKB,  serine/threonine protein kinase family. AKT kinases are known to be
        regulators of cell signaling in response to insulin and growth factors. They
        are involved in a wide variety of biological processes including cell proliferation,
        differentiation, apoptosis, tumorigenesis, as well as glycogen synthesis and
        glucose uptake. This kinase has bee...


        CHGA: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the chromogranin/secretogranin
        family of neuroendocrine secretory proteins. It is found in secretory vesicles
        of neurons and endocrine cells. This gene product is a precursor to three
        biologically active peptides; vasostatin, pancreastatin, and parastatin. These
        peptides act as autocrine or paracrine negative modulators of the neuroendocrine
        system. Tw...


        DCX: This gene encodes a member of the doublecortin family. The protein encoded
        by this gene is a cytoplasmic protein and contains two doublecortin domains,
        which bind microtubules. In the developing cortex, cortical neurons must migrate
        over long distances to reach the site of their final differentiation. The
        encoded protein appears to direct neuronal migration by regulating the organization
        and stability of microtubules. In addition, the encoded protein interacts
        with LIS1, the regulatory gamma subunit of platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase,
        and this interaction is important to proper microtubule function in the developing
        cortex. Mutations in this gene c...


        DPP4: The DPP4 gene encodes dipeptidyl peptidase 4, which is identical to
        adenosine deaminase complexing protein-2, and to the T-cell activation antigen
        CD26. It is an intrinsic type II transmembrane glycoprotein and a serine exopeptidase
        that cleaves X-proline dipeptides from the N-terminus of polypeptides. Dipeptidyl
        peptidase 4 is highly involved in glucose and insulin metabolism, as well
        as in immune regulation. This protein wa...


        ELP4: This gene encodes a component of the six subunit elongator complex,
        a histone acetyltransferase complex that associates directly with RNA polymerase
        II during transcriptional elongation. The human gene can partially complement
        sensitivity phenotypes of yeast ELP4 deletion muta...


        FOXA2: This gene encodes a member of the forkhead class of DNA-binding proteins.
        These hepatocyte nuclear factors are transcriptional activators for liver-specific
        genes such as albumin and transthyretin, and they also interact with chromatin.
        Similar family members in mice have roles in the regulation of metabolism
        and in the differentiation of the pancreas and li...


        FOXO1: This gene belongs to the forkhead family of transcription factors which
        are characterized by a distinct forkhead domain.  The specific function of
        this gene has not yet been determined; however, it may play a role in myogenic
        growth and d...


        G6PC2: This gene encodes an enzyme belonging to the glucose-6-phosphatase
        catalytic subunit family. These enzymes are part of a multicomponent integral
        membrane system that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate, the
        terminal step in gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic pathways, allowing the release
        of glucose into the bloodstream. The family member encoded by this gene is
        found in pancreatic islets and does not exhibit phosphohydrolase...


        GCG: The protein encoded by this gene is actually a preproprotein that is
        cleaved into four distinct mature peptides. One of these, glucagon, is a pancreatic
        hormone that counteracts the glucose-lowering action of insulin by stimulating
        glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Glucagon is a ligand for a specific G-protein
        linked receptor whose signalling pathway controls cell proliferation. Two
        of the ...


        GCK: This gene encodes a member of the hexokinase family of proteins. Hexokinases
        phosphorylate glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate, the first step in most
        glucose metabolism pathways. In contrast to other forms of hexokinase, this
        enzyme is not inhibited by its product glucose-6-phosphate but remains active
        while glucose is abundant. The use of multiple promoters and alternative splicing
        of this gene result in distinct protein isoforms that exhibit tissue-specific
        expression in the pancreas and liver. In the pancreas, this enzyme plays a...


        HNF1A: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcription factor required
        for the expression of several liver-specific genes. The encoded protein functions
        as a homodimer and binds to the inverted palindrome 5''-GTTAATNATTAAC-3''.
        Defects in this gene are a cause of maturity onset diabetes of the young type
        3 (MODY3) an...


        IAPP: This gene encodes a member of the calcitonin family of peptide hormones.
        This hormone is released from pancreatic beta cells following food intake
        to regulate blood glucose levels and act as a satiation signal. Human patients
        with type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes exhibit re...


        INS: This gene encodes insulin, a peptide hormone that plays a vital role
        in the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. After removal of the
        precursor signal peptide, proinsulin is post-translationally cleaved into
        three peptides: the B chain and A chain peptides, which are covalently linked
        via two disulfide bonds to form insulin, and C-peptide. Binding of insulin
        to the insulin receptor (INSR) stimulates glucose uptake. A multitude of mutant
        alleles with phenotypic effects have been identified, including insulin-depen...


        INSM1: Insulinoma-associated 1 (INSM1) gene is intronless and encodes a protein
        containing both a zinc finger DNA-binding domain and a putative prohormone
        domain. This gene is a sensi...


        ISL1: This gene encodes a member of the LIM/homeodomain family of transcription
        factors. The encoded protein binds to the enhancer region of the insulin gene,
        among others, and may play an important role in regulating insulin gene expression.
        The encoded protein is central to the development of pancreatic cell linea...


        LMO2: LMO2 encodes a cysteine-rich, two LIM-domain protein that is required
        for yolk sac erythropoiesis. The LMO2 protein has a central and crucial role
        in hematopoietic development and is highly conserved. The LMO2 transcription
        start site is located approximately 25 kb downstream from the 11p13 T-cell
        translocation cluster (11p13 ttc), where a ...


        MAFB: The protein encoded by this gene is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription
        factor that plays an important role in the regulation of lineage-specific
        hematopoiesis. The encoded nuclear protein represses ETS1-mediat...


        NEUROD1: This gene encodes a member of the NeuroD family of basic helix-loop-helix
        (bHLH) transcription factors. The protein forms heterodimers with other bHLH
        proteins and activates transcription of genes that contain a specific DNA
        sequence known as the E-bo...


        NEUROG3: The protein encoded by this gene is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
        transcription factor involved in neurogenesis. The encoded protein likely
        acts as a heterodimer with another bHLH protein. D...


        NKX2-2: The protein encoded by this gene contains a homeobox domain and may
        be involved in the morphogenesis of the central nervous system. This gene
        is found on chromosome 20 near NKX2-4, and these two genes appear to be duplicated
        on chromosome...


        NKX6-1: In the pancreas, NKX6.1 is required for the development of beta cells
        and is a potent bifunctional transcription regulator that binds to AT-rich
        sequences within the pr...


        PAK3: The protein encoded by this gene is a serine-threonine kinase and forms
        an activated complex with GTP-bound RAS-like (P21), CDC2 and RAC1. This protein
        may be necessary for dendritic development and for the rapid cytoskeletal
        reorganization in dendritic spines associated with synaptic plasticity. Defects
        in this gene are the cau...


        PAX4: This gene is a member of the paired box (PAX) family of transcription
        factors. Members of this gene family typically contain a paired box domain,
        an octapeptide, and a paired-type homeodomain. These genes play critical roles
        during fetal development and cancer growth. The paired box 4 gene is involved
        ...


        PAX6: This gene encodes paired box protein Pax-6, one of many human homologs
        of the Drosophila melanogaster gene prd. In addition to a conserved paired
        box domain, a hallmark feature of this gene family, the encoded protein also
        contains a homeobox domain. Both domains are known to bind DNA and function
        as regulators of gene transcription. Activity of this protein is key in the
        development of neural tissues, particularly the eye. This gene is regulated
        by multiple enhancers located up to hundreds of kilobases distant from this
        locus. Mutations in this gene or in the enhancer regions can cause ocular
        disorders such as aniridia and Peter''s anomaly. Use of alternate promoters
        and alternative splicing results in multiple ...


        PCSK1: This gene encodes a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase
        family, which includes proteases that process protein and peptide precursors
        trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway.
        The encoded protein undergoes an initial autocatalytic processing event in
        the ER to generate a heterodimer which exits the ER and sorts to subcellular
        compartments where a second autocatalytic even takes place and the catalytic
        activity is acquired. The protease is packaged into and activated in dense
        core secretory granules and expressed in the neuroendocrine system and brain.
        This gene encodes one of the seven basic amino acid-specific members which
        cleave their...


        PCSK2: This gene encodes a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase
        family, which includes proteases that process protein and peptide precursors
        trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway.
        The protein undergoes an initial autocatalytic processing event and interacts
        with a neuroendocrine secretory protein in the ER, exits the ER and sorts
        to secretory granules, where it is cleaved and catalytically activated during
        intracellular transport. The encoded protease is packaged into and activated
        in dense core secretory granules and expressed in the neuroendocrine system
        and brain. This gene encodes one of the seven basic amino acid-specific members
        which cleave their substrates at single or paired basic resi...


        PDX1: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional activator of several
        genes, including insulin, somatostatin, glucokinase, islet amyloid polypeptide,
        and glucose transporter type 2. The encoded nuclear protein is involved in
        the early development of the pancreas and plays a major role in glucose-dependent
        regulation of insulin gene expression. Defects in this g...

        protein is an 18kDa subunit of the signal peptidase complex and has been linked
        to cell migration and invasion, gastric cancer and lymph node metastasis.
        Alternative spl...


        SLC2A2: This gene encodes an integral plasma membrane glycoprotein of the
        liver, islet beta cells, intestine, and kidney epithelium. The encoded protein
        mediates facilitated bidirectional glucose transport. Because of its low affinity
        for glucose, it has been suggested as a glucose sensor. Mutations in this
        gene are associated with susceptibility to dise...

        is a subunit of the signal recognition particle receptor (SR). This subunit
        is a transmembrane GTPase belonging to the GTPase superfamily. It anchors
        alpha subunit, a peripheral membrane GTPase, to the...


        SST: The hormone somatostatin has active 14 aa and 28 aa forms that are produced
        by alternate cleavage of the single preproprotein encoded by this gene. Somatostatin
        is expressed throughout the body and inhibits the release of numerous secondary
        hormones by binding to high-affinity G-protein-coupled somatostatin receptors.
        This hormone is an important regulator of the endocrine system through its
        interactions with pituitary growth hormone, ...


        STXBP1: This gene encodes a syntaxin-binding protein. The encoded protein
        appears to play a role in release of neurotransmitters via regulation of syntaxin,

        cytoplasmic C terminus with two tandem C2 domains (C2A and C2B). Synaptotogmin
        family members can form homo- and heteromeric complexes with each other. They
        also have different biochemical properties and developmental profiles, and
        patterns of tissue distributio...


        VDR: This gene encodes vitamin D3 receptor, which is a member of the nuclear
        hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors. This
        receptor also functions as a receptor for the secondary bile acid, lithocholic

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.


        Provide results in the format


        Summary: <high level summary>

        Mechanism: <mechanism>

        Enriched Terms: <term1>; <term2>; <term3>


        For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number
        the list.

        Always put the list of terms last, after mechanism, summary, or hypotheses.



        Here are the gene summaries:



        ABCC8: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of
        ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules
        across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven
        distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). This protein
        is a member of the MRP subfamily which is involved in multi-drug resistance.
        This protein functions as a modulator of ATP-sensitive potassium channels
        and insulin release. Mutations in the ABCC8 gene and deficiencies in the encoded
        protein have been observed in patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemi...


        AKT3: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the AKT, also called
        PKB,  serine/threonine protein kinase family. AKT kinases are known to be
        regulators of cell signaling in response to insulin and growth factors. They
        are involved in a wide variety of biological processes including cell proliferation,
        differentiation, apoptosis, tumorigenesis, as well as glycogen synthesis and
        glucose uptake. This kinase has bee...


        CHGA: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the chromogranin/secretogranin
        family of neuroendocrine secretory proteins. It is found in secretory vesicles
        of neurons and endocrine cells. This gene product is a precursor to three
        biologically active peptides; vasostatin, pancreastatin, and parastatin. These
        peptides act as autocrine or paracrine negative modulators of the neuroendocrine
        system. Tw...


        DCX: This gene encodes a member of the doublecortin family. The protein encoded
        by this gene is a cytoplasmic protein and contains two doublecortin domains,
        which bind microtubules. In the developing cortex, cortical neurons must migrate
        over long distances to reach the site of their final differentiation. The
        encoded protein appears to direct neuronal migration by regulating the organization
        and stability of microtubules. In addition, the encoded protein interacts
        with LIS1, the regulatory gamma subunit of platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase,
        and this interaction is important to proper microtubule function in the developing
        cortex. Mutations in this gene c...


        DPP4: The DPP4 gene encodes dipeptidyl peptidase 4, which is identical to
        adenosine deaminase complexing protein-2, and to the T-cell activation antigen
        CD26. It is an intrinsic type II transmembrane glycoprotein and a serine exopeptidase
        that cleaves X-proline dipeptides from the N-terminus of polypeptides. Dipeptidyl
        peptidase 4 is highly involved in glucose and insulin metabolism, as well
        as in immune regulation. This protein wa...


        ELP4: This gene encodes a component of the six subunit elongator complex,
        a histone acetyltransferase complex that associates directly with RNA polymerase
        II during transcriptional elongation. The human gene can partially complement
        sensitivity phenotypes of yeast ELP4 deletion muta...


        FOXA2: This gene encodes a member of the forkhead class of DNA-binding proteins.
        These hepatocyte nuclear factors are transcriptional activators for liver-specific
        genes such as albumin and transthyretin, and they also interact with chromatin.
        Similar family members in mice have roles in the regulation of metabolism
        and in the differentiation of the pancreas and li...


        FOXO1: This gene belongs to the forkhead family of transcription factors which
        are characterized by a distinct forkhead domain.  The specific function of
        this gene has not yet been determined; however, it may play a role in myogenic
        growth and d...


        G6PC2: This gene encodes an enzyme belonging to the glucose-6-phosphatase
        catalytic subunit family. These enzymes are part of a multicomponent integral
        membrane system that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate, the
        terminal step in gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic pathways, allowing the release
        of glucose into the bloodstream. The family member encoded by this gene is
        found in pancreatic islets and does not exhibit phosphohydrolase...


        GCG: The protein encoded by this gene is actually a preproprotein that is
        cleaved into four distinct mature peptides. One of these, glucagon, is a pancreatic
        hormone that counteracts the glucose-lowering action of insulin by stimulating
        glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Glucagon is a ligand for a specific G-protein
        linked receptor whose signalling pathway controls cell proliferation. Two
        of the ...


        GCK: This gene encodes a member of the hexokinase family of proteins. Hexokinases
        phosphorylate glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate, the first step in most
        glucose metabolism pathways. In contrast to other forms of hexokinase, this
        enzyme is not inhibited by its product glucose-6-phosphate but remains active
        while glucose is abundant. The use of multiple promoters and alternative splicing
        of this gene result in distinct protein isoforms that exhibit tissue-specific
        expression in the pancreas and liver. In the pancreas, this enzyme plays a...


        HNF1A: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcription factor required
        for the expression of several liver-specific genes. The encoded protein functions
        as a homodimer and binds to the inverted palindrome 5''-GTTAATNATTAAC-3''.
        Defects in this gene are a cause of maturity onset diabetes of the young type
        3 (MODY3) an...


        IAPP: This gene encodes a member of the calcitonin family of peptide hormones.
        This hormone is released from pancreatic beta cells following food intake
        to regulate blood glucose levels and act as a satiation signal. Human patients
        with type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes exhibit re...


        INS: This gene encodes insulin, a peptide hormone that plays a vital role
        in the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. After removal of the
        precursor signal peptide, proinsulin is post-translationally cleaved into
        three peptides: the B chain and A chain peptides, which are covalently linked
        via two disulfide bonds to form insulin, and C-peptide. Binding of insulin
        to the insulin receptor (INSR) stimulates glucose uptake. A multitude of mutant
        alleles with phenotypic effects have been identified, including insulin-depen...


        INSM1: Insulinoma-associated 1 (INSM1) gene is intronless and encodes a protein
        containing both a zinc finger DNA-binding domain and a putative prohormone
        domain. This gene is a sensi...


        ISL1: This gene encodes a member of the LIM/homeodomain family of transcription
        factors. The encoded protein binds to the enhancer region of the insulin gene,
        among others, and may play an important role in regulating insulin gene expression.
        The encoded protein is central to the development of pancreatic cell linea...


        LMO2: LMO2 encodes a cysteine-rich, two LIM-domain protein that is required
        for yolk sac erythropoiesis. The LMO2 protein has a central and crucial role
        in hematopoietic development and is highly conserved. The LMO2 transcription
        start site is located approximately 25 kb downstream from the 11p13 T-cell
        translocation cluster (11p13 ttc), where a ...


        MAFB: The protein encoded by this gene is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription
        factor that plays an important role in the regulation of lineage-specific
        hematopoiesis. The encoded nuclear protein represses ETS1-mediat...


        NEUROD1: This gene encodes a member of the NeuroD family of basic helix-loop-helix
        (bHLH) transcription factors. The protein forms heterodimers with other bHLH
        proteins and activates transcription of genes that contain a specific DNA
        sequence known as the E-bo...


        NEUROG3: The protein encoded by this gene is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
        transcription factor involved in neurogenesis. The encoded protein likely
        acts as a heterodimer with another bHLH protein. D...


        NKX2-2: The protein encoded by this gene contains a homeobox domain and may
        be involved in the morphogenesis of the central nervous system. This gene
        is found on chromosome 20 near NKX2-4, and these two genes appear to be duplicated
        on chromosome...


        NKX6-1: In the pancreas, NKX6.1 is required for the development of beta cells
        and is a potent bifunctional transcription regulator that binds to AT-rich
        sequences within the pr...


        PAK3: The protein encoded by this gene is a serine-threonine kinase and forms
        an activated complex with GTP-bound RAS-like (P21), CDC2 and RAC1. This protein
        may be necessary for dendritic development and for the rapid cytoskeletal
        reorganization in dendritic spines associated with synaptic plasticity. Defects
        in this gene are the cau...


        PAX4: This gene is a member of the paired box (PAX) family of transcription
        factors. Members of this gene family typically contain a paired box domain,
        an octapeptide, and a paired-type homeodomain. These genes play critical roles
        during fetal development and cancer growth. The paired box 4 gene is involved
        ...


        PAX6: This gene encodes paired box protein Pax-6, one of many human homologs
        of the Drosophila melanogaster gene prd. In addition to a conserved paired
        box domain, a hallmark feature of this gene family, the encoded protein also
        contains a homeobox domain. Both domains are known to bind DNA and function
        as regulators of gene transcription. Activity of this protein is key in the
        development of neural tissues, particularly the eye. This gene is regulated
        by multiple enhancers located up to hundreds of kilobases distant from this
        locus. Mutations in this gene or in the enhancer regions can cause ocular
        disorders such as aniridia and Peter''s anomaly. Use of alternate promoters
        and alternative splicing results in multiple ...


        PCSK1: This gene encodes a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase
        family, which includes proteases that process protein and peptide precursors
        trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway.
        The encoded protein undergoes an initial autocatalytic processing event in
        the ER to generate a heterodimer which exits the ER and sorts to subcellular
        compartments where a second autocatalytic even takes place and the catalytic
        activity is acquired. The protease is packaged into and activated in dense
        core secretory granules and expressed in the neuroendocrine system and brain.
        This gene encodes one of the seven basic amino acid-specific members which
        cleave their...


        PCSK2: This gene encodes a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase
        family, which includes proteases that process protein and peptide precursors
        trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway.
        The protein undergoes an initial autocatalytic processing event and interacts
        with a neuroendocrine secretory protein in the ER, exits the ER and sorts
        to secretory granules, where it is cleaved and catalytically activated during
        intracellular transport. The encoded protease is packaged into and activated
        in dense core secretory granules and expressed in the neuroendocrine system
        and brain. This gene encodes one of the seven basic amino acid-specific members
        which cleave their substrates at single or paired basic resi...


        PDX1: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional activator of several
        genes, including insulin, somatostatin, glucokinase, islet amyloid polypeptide,
        and glucose transporter type 2. The encoded nuclear protein is involved in
        the early development of the pancreas and plays a major role in glucose-dependent
        regulation of insulin gene expression. Defects in this g...

        is a transmembrane GTPase belonging to the GTPase superfamily. It anchors
        alpha subunit, a peripheral membrane GTPase, to the...


        SST: The hormone somatostatin has active 14 aa and 28 aa forms that are produced
        by alternate cleavage of the single preproprotein encoded by this gene. Somatostatin
        is expressed throughout the body and inhibits the release of numerous secondary
        hormones by binding to high-affinity G-protein-coupled somatostatin receptors.
        This hormone is an important regulator of the endocrine system through its
        interactions with pituitary growth hormone, ...


        STXBP1: This gene encodes a syntaxin-binding protein. The encoded protein

        SYT13: This gene encodes a member of the large synaptotagmin protein family.
        Family members have an extracellular N-terminal transmembrane domain and a
        cytoplasmic C terminus with two tandem C2 domains (C2A and C2B). Synaptotogmin
        family members can form homo- and heteromeric complexes with each other. They
        also have different biochemical properties and developmental profiles, and
        patterns of tissue distributio...


        VDR: This gene encodes vitamin D3 receptor, which is a member of the nuclear
        hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors. This
        receptor also functions as a receptor for the secondary bile acid, lithocholic
        acid. Downstream targets of vitamin D3 receptor are principally involved in
        mineral metabolism, though this receptor regulates a variety of other metabolic
        pathways, such as those involved in immune response and cancer. Mutations
        in this gene are associated with type II vitamin D-resistant rickets. A single
        nucleotide polymorphism in the initiation codon results in an alternate translation
        start site three co...

        Here are the gene summaries:



        DPP4: The DPP4 gene encodes dipeptidyl peptidase 4, which is identical to
        adenosine deaminase complexing protein-2, and to the T-cell activation antigen
        CD26. It is an intrinsic type II transmembrane glycoprotein and a serine exopeptidase
        that cleaves X-proline dipeptides from the N-terminus of polypeptides. Dipeptidyl
        peptidase 4 is highly involved in glucose and insulin metabolism, as well
        as in immune regulation. This protein was shown to be a functional receptor
        for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and protei...


        SCGN: The encoded protein is a secreted calcium-binding protein which is found
        in the cytoplasm. It is related to calbindin D-28K and calretinin. This protein
        is thought to be involved in KCL-stimulated calcium flux a...


        PKLR: The protein encoded by this gene is a pyruvate kinase that catalyzes
        the transphosphorylation of phohsphoenolpyruvate into pyruvate and ATP, which
        is the rate-limiting step of glycolysis. Defects in this enzyme, due to gene
        mutations or genetic variations, are the common cause of chronic hereditary
        nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA or HNSHA). Multiple transcript vari...


        PAX4: This gene is a member of the paired box (PAX) family of transcription
        factors. Members of this gene family typically contain a paired box domain,
        an octapeptide, and a paired-type homeodomain. These genes play critical roles
        during fetal development and cancer growth. The paired box 4 gene is involved
        in pancreatic islet development and mouse studies have demonstrated a role
        f...


        NEUROD1: This gene encodes a member of the NeuroD family of basic helix-loop-helix
        (bHLH) transcription factors. The protein forms heterodimers with other bHLH
        proteins and activates transcription of genes that contain a specific DNA
        sequence known as the E-box. It regulates expression of the insulin gene,
        and mutations i...


        SRPRB: The protein encoded by this gene has similarity to mouse protein which
        is a subunit of the signal recognition particle receptor (SR). This subunit
        is a transmembrane GTPase belonging to the GTPase superfamily. It anchors
        alpha subunit, a peripheral membrane GTPase, to the ER membrane. SR is required
        for the cotranslational targeting of bo...


        SRP14: Enables RNA binding activity. Involved in protein targeting to ER.
        Located in nucleus. Part of signal recognition particle, endoplasmic reticulum
        targeting. [provided ...


        ISL1: This gene encodes a member of the LIM/homeodomain family of transcription
        factors. The encoded protein binds to the enhancer region of the insulin gene,
        among others, and may play an important role in regulating insulin gene expression.
        The encoded protein is central to the development of pancreatic cell lineages
        and may also be required for motor neuron generation. Mutations in this g...


        INSM1: Insulinoma-associated 1 (INSM1) gene is intronless and encodes a protein
        containing both a zinc finger DNA-binding domain and a putative prohormone
        domain. This gene is a sensitive marker for neuroendocrine differentiati...


        PAK3: The protein encoded by this gene is a serine-threonine kinase and forms
        an activated complex with GTP-bound RAS-like (P21), CDC2 and RAC1. This protein
        may be necessary for dendritic development and for the rapid cytoskeletal
        reorganization in dendritic spines associated with synaptic plasticity. Defects
        in this gene are the cause of a non-syndromic form of X-linked intellectual
        disability. Alternatively spli...


        PAX6: This gene encodes paired box protein Pax-6, one of many human homologs
        of the Drosophila melanogaster gene prd. In addition to a conserved paired
        box domain, a hallmark feature of this gene family, the encoded protein also
        contains a homeobox domain. Both domains are known to bind DNA and function
        as regulators of gene transcription. Activity of this protein is key in the
        development of neural tissues, particularly the eye. This gene is regulated
        by multiple enhancers located up to hundreds of kilobases distant from this
        locus. Mutations in this gene or in the enhancer regions can cause ocular
        disorders such as aniridia and Peter''s anomaly. Use of alternate promoters
        and alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms. Interestingly, inclusion of a particular alternate coding
        exon has been shown to increase the length of the paired box domain and a...


        ELP4: This gene encodes a component of the six subunit elongator complex,
        a histone acetyltransferase complex that associates directly with RNA polymerase
        II during transcriptional elongation. The human gene can partially complement
        sensitivity phenotypes of yeast ELP4 deletion mutants. This gene has also
        been associated with Rolandic epilepsy. Alter...


        DCX: This gene encodes a member of the doublecortin family. The protein encoded
        by this gene is a cytoplasmic protein and contains two doublecortin domains,
        which bind microtubules. In the developing cortex, cortical neurons must migrate
        over long distances to reach the site of their final differentiation. The
        encoded protein appears to direct neuronal migration by regulating the organization
        and stability of microtubules. In addition, the encoded protein interacts
        with LIS1, the regulatory gamma subunit of platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase,
        and this interaction is important to proper microtubule function in the developing
        cortex. Mutations in this gene cause abnormal migration of neurons during
        development and disrupt the layering of the cortex, leading to epilepsy, cognitive
        disability, subcortical band heterotopia (...


        IAPP: This gene encodes a member of the calcitonin family of peptide hormones.
        This hormone is released from pancreatic beta cells following food intake
        to regulate blood glucose levels and act as a satiation signal. Human patients
        with type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes exhibit reduced levels of the encoded
        hormone in blood and pancreas. This prote...


        LMO2: LMO2 encodes a cysteine-rich, two LIM-domain protein that is required
        for yolk sac erythropoiesis. The LMO2 protein has a central and crucial role
        in hematopoietic development and is highly conserved. The LMO2 transcription
        start site is located approximately 25 kb downstream from the 11p13 T-cell
        translocation cluster (11p13 ttc), where a number T-cell acute lymphoblastic
        leukemia-specific translocations occur. Alternative ...


        NEUROG3: The protein encoded by this gene is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
        transcription factor involved in neurogenesis. The encoded protein likely
        acts as a heterodimer with another bHLH protein. Defects in this gene are
        a cause of congenital ma...


        GCK: This gene encodes a member of the hexokinase family of proteins. Hexokinases
        phosphorylate glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate, the first step in most
        glucose metabolism pathways. In contrast to other forms of hexokinase, this
        enzyme is not inhibited by its product glucose-6-phosphate but remains active
        while glucose is abundant. The use of multiple promoters and alternative splicing
        of this gene result in distinct protein isoforms that exhibit tissue-specific
        expression in the pancreas and liver. In the pancreas, this enzyme plays a
        role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, while in the liver, this enzyme
        is important in glucose uptake and conversion to glycogen...


        STXBP1: This gene encodes a syntaxin-binding protein. The encoded protein
        appears to play a role in release of neurotransmitters via regulation of syntaxin,
        a transmembrane attachment protein receptor. Mutations in this gene have been
        associated with infantile epileptic encephalopathy-4. Alternatively spli...


        NKX2-2: The protein encoded by this gene contains a homeobox domain and may
        be involved in the morphogenesis of the central nervous system. This gene
        is found on chromosome 20 near NKX2-4, and these two genes appear to be duplicated
        on chromosome 14 in the form of TITF1 and NKX2-8. The encoded protein is ...


        PDX1: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional activator of several
        genes, including insulin, somatostatin, glucokinase, islet amyloid polypeptide,
        and glucose transporter type 2. The encoded nuclear protein is involved in
        the early development of the pancreas and plays a major role in glucose-dependent
        regulation of insulin gene expression. Defects in this gene are a cause of
        pancreatic agenesis, which can lead to early-onset insulin-dependent diab...


        SST: The hormone somatostatin has active 14 aa and 28 aa forms that are produced
        by alternate cleavage of the single preproprotein encoded by this gene. Somatostatin
        is expressed throughout the body and inhibits the release of numerous secondary
        hormones by binding to high-affinity G-protein-coupled somatostatin receptors.
        This hormone is an important regulator of the endocrine system through its
        interactions with pituitary growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, and
        most hormones of the gastrointestinal tract. Somatostatin also affects rates...


        PCSK1: This gene encodes a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase
        family, which includes proteases that process protein and peptide precursors
        trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway.
        The encoded protein undergoes an initial autocatalytic processing event in
        the ER to generate a heterodimer which exits the ER and sorts to subcellular
        compartments where a second autocatalytic even takes place and the catalytic
        activity is acquired. The protease is packaged into and activated in dense
        core secretory granules and expressed in the neuroendocrine system and brain.
        This gene encodes one of the seven basic amino acid-specific members which
        cleave their substrates at single or paired basic residues. It functions in
        the proteolytic activation of polypeptide hormones and neuropeptides precursors.
        Mutations in this gene have be...


        AKT3: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the AKT, also called
        PKB,  serine/threonine protein kinase family. AKT kinases are known to be
        regulators of cell signaling in response to insulin and growth factors. They
        are involved in a wide variety of biological processes including cell proliferation,
        differentiation, apoptosis, tumorigenesis, as well as glycogen synthesis and
        glucose uptake. This kinase has been shown to be stimulated by platelet-derived
        growth factor (PDGF), insulin, and insulin-like growth facto...


        SYT13: This gene encodes a member of the large synaptotagmin protein family.
        Family members have an extracellular N-terminal transmembrane domain and a
        cytoplasmic C terminus with two tandem C2 domains (C2A and C2B). Synaptotogmin
        family members can form homo- and heteromeric complexes with each other. They
        also have different biochemical properties and developmental profiles, and
        patterns of tissue distribution. Synaptotagmins function as membrane traffickers
        in multicellular organisms. Two alternatively spli...


        ABCC8: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of
        ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules
        across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven
        distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). This protein
        is a member of the MRP subfamily which is involved in multi-drug resistance.
        This protein functions as a modulator of ATP-sensitive potassium channels
        and insulin release. Mutations in the ABCC8 gene and deficiencies in the encoded
        protein have been observed in patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia
        of infancy, an autosomal recessive disorder of unregulated and high insulin
        secretion. Mutations have also been associated with non-insulin-dependent
        d...


        NKX6-1: In the pancreas, NKX6.1 is required for the development of beta cells
        and is a potent bifunctional transcription regulator that binds to AT-rich
        sequences within the promoter region of target genes Iype et al. ...


        INS: This gene encodes insulin, a peptide hormone that plays a vital role
        in the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. After removal of the
        precursor signal peptide, proinsulin is post-translationally cleaved into
        three peptides: the B chain and A chain peptides, which are covalently linked
        via two disulfide bonds to form insulin, and C-peptide. Binding of insulin
        to the insulin receptor (INSR) stimulates glucose uptake. A multitude of mutant
        alleles with phenotypic effects have been identified, including insulin-dependent
        diabetes mellitus, permanent neonatal diabetes diabetes mellitus, maturity-onset
        diabetes of the young type 10 and hyperproinsul...


        PCSK2: This gene encodes a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase
        family, which includes proteases that process protein and peptide precursors
        trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway.
        The protein undergoes an initial autocatalytic processing event and interacts
        with a neuroendocrine secretory protein in the ER, exits the ER and sorts
        to secretory granules, where it is cleaved and catalytically activated during
        intracellular transport. The encoded protease is packaged into and activated
        in dense core secretory granules and expressed in the neuroendocrine system
        and brain. This gene encodes one of the seven basic amino acid-specific members
        which cleave their substrates at single or paired basic residues. It functions
        in the proteolytic activation of polypeptide hormones and neuropeptides precursors.
        Single nucleotide polymorphisms in this gene may increase susceptibility to
        myocardia...

        of endoplasmic reticulum membrane. [pro...


        G6PC2: This gene encodes an enzyme belonging to the glucose-6-phosphatase
        catalytic subunit family. These enzymes are part of a multicomponent integral
        membrane system that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate, the
        terminal step in gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic pathways, allowing the release
        of glucose into the bloodstream. The family member encoded by this gene is
        found in pancreatic islets and does not exhibit phosphohydrolase activity,
        but it is a major target of cell-mediated autoimmunity in diabetes. Several
        alternatively spliced t...


        FOXO1: This gene belongs to the forkhead family of transcription factors which
        are characterized by a distinct forkhead domain.  The specific function of
        this gene has not yet been determined; however, it may play a role in myogenic
        growth and differentiation. Translocation of this gene with PAX3 has bee...

        Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A related pse...


        VDR: This gene encodes vitamin D3 receptor, which is a member of the nuclear
        hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors. This
        receptor also functions as a receptor for the secondary bile acid, lithocholic
        acid. Downstream targets of vitamin D3 receptor are principally involved in
        mineral metabolism, though this receptor regulates a variety of other metabolic
        pathways, such as those involved in immune response and cancer. Mutations
        in this gene are associated with type II vitamin D-resistant rickets. A single
        nucleotide polymorphism in the initiation codon results in an alternate translation

        These hepatocyte nuclear factors are transcriptional activators for liver-specific
        genes such as albumin and transthyretin, and they also interact with chromatin.
        Similar family members in mice have roles in the regulation of metabolism

        Here are the gene summaries:



        DPP4: The DPP4 gene encodes dipeptidyl peptidase 4, which is identical to
        adenosine deaminase complexing protein-2, and to the T-cell activation antigen
        CD26. It is an intrinsic type II transmembrane glycoprotein and a serine exopeptidase
        that cleaves X-proline dipeptides from the N-terminus of polypeptides. Dipeptidyl
        peptidase 4 is highly involved in glucose and insulin metabolism, as well
        as in immune regulation. This protein was shown to be a functional receptor
        for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and protei...


        SCGN: The encoded protein is a secreted calcium-binding protein which is found
        in the cytoplasm. It is related to calbindin D-28K and calretinin. This protein
        is thought to be involved in KCL-stimulated calcium flux a...


        PKLR: The protein encoded by this gene is a pyruvate kinase that catalyzes
        the transphosphorylation of phohsphoenolpyruvate into pyruvate and ATP, which
        is the rate-limiting step of glycolysis. Defects in this enzyme, due to gene
        mutations or genetic variations, are the common cause of chronic hereditary
        nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA or HNSHA). Multiple transcript vari...


        PAX4: This gene is a member of the paired box (PAX) family of transcription
        factors. Members of this gene family typically contain a paired box domain,
        an octapeptide, and a paired-type homeodomain. These genes play critical roles
        during fetal development and cancer growth. The paired box 4 gene is involved
        in pancreatic islet development and mouse studies have demonstrated a role
        f...


        NEUROD1: This gene encodes a member of the NeuroD family of basic helix-loop-helix
        (bHLH) transcription factors. The protein forms heterodimers with other bHLH
        proteins and activates transcription of genes that contain a specific DNA
        sequence known as the E-box. It regulates expression of the insulin gene,
        and mutations i...


        SRPRB: The protein encoded by this gene has similarity to mouse protein which
        is a subunit of the signal recognition particle receptor (SR). This subunit
        is a transmembrane GTPase belonging to the GTPase superfamily. It anchors
        alpha subunit, a peripheral membrane GTPase, to the ER membrane. SR is required
        for the cotranslational targeting of bo...


        SRP14: Enables RNA binding activity. Involved in protein targeting to ER.
        Located in nucleus. Part of signal recognition particle, endoplasmic reticulum
        targeting. [provided ...


        ISL1: This gene encodes a member of the LIM/homeodomain family of transcription
        factors. The encoded protein binds to the enhancer region of the insulin gene,
        among others, and may play an important role in regulating insulin gene expression.
        The encoded protein is central to the development of pancreatic cell lineages
        and may also be required for motor neuron generation. Mutations in this g...


        INSM1: Insulinoma-associated 1 (INSM1) gene is intronless and encodes a protein
        containing both a zinc finger DNA-binding domain and a putative prohormone
        domain. This gene is a sensitive marker for neuroendocrine differentiati...


        PAK3: The protein encoded by this gene is a serine-threonine kinase and forms
        an activated complex with GTP-bound RAS-like (P21), CDC2 and RAC1. This protein
        may be necessary for dendritic development and for the rapid cytoskeletal
        reorganization in dendritic spines associated with synaptic plasticity. Defects
        in this gene are the cause of a non-syndromic form of X-linked intellectual
        disability. Alternatively spli...


        PAX6: This gene encodes paired box protein Pax-6, one of many human homologs
        of the Drosophila melanogaster gene prd. In addition to a conserved paired
        box domain, a hallmark feature of this gene family, the encoded protein also
        contains a homeobox domain. Both domains are known to bind DNA and function
        as regulators of gene transcription. Activity of this protein is key in the
        development of neural tissues, particularly the eye. This gene is regulated
        by multiple enhancers located up to hundreds of kilobases distant from this
        locus. Mutations in this gene or in the enhancer regions can cause ocular
        disorders such as aniridia and Peter''s anomaly. Use of alternate promoters
        and alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding
        different isoforms. Interestingly, inclusion of a particular alternate coding
        exon has been shown to increase the length of the paired box domain and a...


        ELP4: This gene encodes a component of the six subunit elongator complex,
        a histone acetyltransferase complex that associates directly with RNA polymerase
        II during transcriptional elongation. The human gene can partially complement
        sensitivity phenotypes of yeast ELP4 deletion mutants. This gene has also
        been associated with Rolandic epilepsy. Alter...


        DCX: This gene encodes a member of the doublecortin family. The protein encoded
        by this gene is a cytoplasmic protein and contains two doublecortin domains,
        which bind microtubules. In the developing cortex, cortical neurons must migrate
        over long distances to reach the site of their final differentiation. The
        encoded protein appears to direct neuronal migration by regulating the organization
        and stability of microtubules. In addition, the encoded protein interacts
        with LIS1, the regulatory gamma subunit of platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase,
        and this interaction is important to proper microtubule function in the developing
        cortex. Mutations in this gene cause abnormal migration of neurons during
        development and disrupt the layering of the cortex, leading to epilepsy, cognitive
        disability, subcortical band heterotopia (...


        IAPP: This gene encodes a member of the calcitonin family of peptide hormones.
        This hormone is released from pancreatic beta cells following food intake
        to regulate blood glucose levels and act as a satiation signal. Human patients
        with type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes exhibit reduced levels of the encoded
        hormone in blood and pancreas. This prote...


        LMO2: LMO2 encodes a cysteine-rich, two LIM-domain protein that is required
        for yolk sac erythropoiesis. The LMO2 protein has a central and crucial role
        in hematopoietic development and is highly conserved. The LMO2 transcription
        start site is located approximately 25 kb downstream from the 11p13 T-cell
        translocation cluster (11p13 ttc), where a number T-cell acute lymphoblastic
        leukemia-specific translocations occur. Alternative ...


        NEUROG3: The protein encoded by this gene is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
        transcription factor involved in neurogenesis. The encoded protein likely
        acts as a heterodimer with another bHLH protein. Defects in this gene are
        a cause of congenital ma...


        GCK: This gene encodes a member of the hexokinase family of proteins. Hexokinases
        phosphorylate glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate, the first step in most
        glucose metabolism pathways. In contrast to other forms of hexokinase, this
        enzyme is not inhibited by its product glucose-6-phosphate but remains active
        while glucose is abundant. The use of multiple promoters and alternative splicing
        of this gene result in distinct protein isoforms that exhibit tissue-specific
        expression in the pancreas and liver. In the pancreas, this enzyme plays a
        role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, while in the liver, this enzyme
        is important in glucose uptake and conversion to glycogen...


        STXBP1: This gene encodes a syntaxin-binding protein. The encoded protein
        appears to play a role in release of neurotransmitters via regulation of syntaxin,
        a transmembrane attachment protein receptor. Mutations in this gene have been
        associated with infantile epileptic encephalopathy-4. Alternatively spli...


        NKX2-2: The protein encoded by this gene contains a homeobox domain and may
        be involved in the morphogenesis of the central nervous system. This gene
        is found on chromosome 20 near NKX2-4, and these two genes appear to be duplicated
        on chromosome 14 in the form of TITF1 and NKX2-8. The encoded protein is ...


        PDX1: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional activator of several
        genes, including insulin, somatostatin, glucokinase, islet amyloid polypeptide,
        and glucose transporter type 2. The encoded nuclear protein is involved in
        the early development of the pancreas and plays a major role in glucose-dependent
        regulation of insulin gene expression. Defects in this gene are a cause of
        pancreatic agenesis, which can lead to early-onset insulin-dependent diab...


        SST: The hormone somatostatin has active 14 aa and 28 aa forms that are produced
        by alternate cleavage of the single preproprotein encoded by this gene. Somatostatin
        is expressed throughout the body and inhibits the release of numerous secondary
        hormones by binding to high-affinity G-protein-coupled somatostatin receptors.
        This hormone is an important regulator of the endocrine system through its
        interactions with pituitary growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, and
        most hormones of the gastrointestinal tract. Somatostatin also affects rates...


        PCSK1: This gene encodes a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase
        family, which includes proteases that process protein and peptide precursors
        trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway.
        The encoded protein undergoes an initial autocatalytic processing event in
        the ER to generate a heterodimer which exits the ER and sorts to subcellular
        compartments where a second autocatalytic even takes place and the catalytic
        activity is acquired. The protease is packaged into and activated in dense
        core secretory granules and expressed in the neuroendocrine system and brain.
        This gene encodes one of the seven basic amino acid-specific members which
        cleave their substrates at single or paired basic residues. It functions in
        the proteolytic activation of polypeptide hormones and neuropeptides precursors.
        Mutations in this gene have be...


        AKT3: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the AKT, also called
        PKB,  serine/threonine protein kinase family. AKT kinases are known to be
        regulators of cell signaling in response to insulin and growth factors. They
        are involved in a wide variety of biological processes including cell proliferation,
        differentiation, apoptosis, tumorigenesis, as well as glycogen synthesis and
        glucose uptake. This kinase has been shown to be stimulated by platelet-derived
        growth factor (PDGF), insulin, and insulin-like growth facto...


        SYT13: This gene encodes a member of the large synaptotagmin protein family.
        Family members have an extracellular N-terminal transmembrane domain and a
        cytoplasmic C terminus with two tandem C2 domains (C2A and C2B). Synaptotogmin
        family members can form homo- and heteromeric complexes with each other. They
        also have different biochemical properties and developmental profiles, and
        patterns of tissue distribution. Synaptotagmins function as membrane traffickers
        in multicellular organisms. Two alternatively spli...


        ABCC8: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of
        ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules
        across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven
        distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). This protein
        is a member of the MRP subfamily which is involved in multi-drug resistance.
        This protein functions as a modulator of ATP-sensitive potassium channels
        and insulin release. Mutations in the ABCC8 gene and deficiencies in the encoded
        protein have been observed in patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia
        of infancy, an autosomal recessive disorder of unregulated and high insulin
        secretion. Mutations have also been associated with non-insulin-dependent
        d...


        NKX6-1: In the pancreas, NKX6.1 is required for the development of beta cells
        and is a potent bifunctional transcription regulator that binds to AT-rich
        sequences within the promoter region of target genes Iype et al. ...


        INS: This gene encodes insulin, a peptide hormone that plays a vital role
        in the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. After removal of the
        precursor signal peptide, proinsulin is post-translationally cleaved into
        three peptides: the B chain and A chain peptides, which are covalently linked
        via two disulfide bonds to form insulin, and C-peptide. Binding of insulin
        to the insulin receptor (INSR) stimulates glucose uptake. A multitude of mutant
        alleles with phenotypic effects have been identified, including insulin-dependent
        diabetes mellitus, permanent neonatal diabetes diabetes mellitus, maturity-onset
        diabetes of the young type 10 and hyperproinsul...


        PCSK2: This gene encodes a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase
        family, which includes proteases that process protein and peptide precursors
        trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway.
        The protein undergoes an initial autocatalytic processing event and interacts
        with a neuroendocrine secretory protein in the ER, exits the ER and sorts
        to secretory granules, where it is cleaved and catalytically activated during
        intracellular transport. The encoded protease is packaged into and activated
        in dense core secretory granules and expressed in the neuroendocrine system
        and brain. This gene encodes one of the seven basic amino acid-specific members
        which cleave their substrates at single or paired basic residues. It functions
        in the proteolytic activation of polypeptide hormones and neuropeptides precursors.
        Single nucleotide polymorphisms in this gene may increase susceptibility to
        myocardia...


        SPCS1: Predicted to enable peptidase activity and ribosome binding activity.
        Involved in viral protein processing and virion assembly. Is integral component
        of endoplasmic reticulum membrane. [pro...


        G6PC2: This gene encodes an enzyme belonging to the glucose-6-phosphatase
        catalytic subunit family. These enzymes are part of a multicomponent integral
        membrane system that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate, the
        terminal step in gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic pathways, allowing the release
        of glucose into the bloodstream. The family member encoded by this gene is
        found in pancreatic islets and does not exhibit phosphohydrolase activity,
        but it is a major target of cell-mediated autoimmunity in diabetes. Several
        alternatively spliced t...


        FOXO1: This gene belongs to the forkhead family of transcription factors which
        are characterized by a distinct forkhead domain.  The specific function of
        this gene has not yet been determined; however, it may play a role in myogenic
        growth and differentiation. Translocation of this gene with PAX3 has bee...


        SEC11A: This gene encodes a member of the peptidase S26B family. The encoded
        protein is an 18kDa subunit of the signal peptidase complex and has been linked
        to cell migration and invasion, gastric cancer and lymph node metastasis.
        Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A related pse...


        VDR: This gene encodes vitamin D3 receptor, which is a member of the nuclear
        hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors. This
        receptor also functions as a receptor for the secondary bile acid, lithocholic
        acid. Downstream targets of vitamin D3 receptor are principally involved in

        adenosine deaminase complexing protein-2, and to the T-cell activation antigen
        CD26. It is an intrinsic type II transmembrane glycoprotein and a serine exopeptidase
        that cleaves X-proline dipeptides from the N-terminus of polypeptides. Dipeptidyl
        peptidase 4 is highly involved in glucose and insulin metabolism, as well
        as in immune regulation. This protein wa...


        SCGN: The encoded protein is a secreted calcium-binding protein which is found

        mutations or genetic variations, are the common cause of chronic hereditary...


        PAX4: This gene is a member of the paired box (PAX) family of transcription
        factors. Members of this gene family typically contain a paired box domain,
        an octapeptide, and a paired-type homeodomain. These genes play critical roles
        during fetal development and cancer growth. The paired box 4 gene is involved
        ...


        NEUROD1: This gene encodes a member of the NeuroD family of basic helix-loop-helix
        (bHLH) transcription factors. The protein forms heterodimers with other bHLH
        proteins and activates transcription of genes that contain a specific DNA
        sequence known as the E-bo...


        SRPRB: The protein encoded by this gene has similarity to mouse protein which
        is a subunit of the signal recognition particle receptor (SR). This subunit

        The encoded protein is central to the development of pancreatic cell linea...


        INSM1: Insulinoma-associated 1 (INSM1) gene is intronless and encodes a protein
        containing both a zinc finger DNA-binding domain and a putative prohormone
        domain. This gene is a sensi...


        PAK3: The protein encoded by this gene is a serine-threonine kinase and forms
        an activated complex with GTP-bound RAS-like (P21), CDC2 and RAC1. This protein
        may be necessary for dendritic development and for the rapid cytoskeletal
        reorganization in dendritic spines associated with synaptic plasticity. Defects
        in this gene are the cau...


        PAX6: This gene encodes paired box protein Pax-6, one of many human homologs
        of the Drosophila melanogaster gene prd. In addition to a conserved paired
        box domain, a hallmark feature of this gene family, the encoded protein also
        contains a homeobox domain. Both domains are known to bind DNA and function
        as regulators of gene transcription. Activity of this protein is key in the
        development of neural tissues, particularly the eye. This gene is regulated
        by multiple enhancers located up to hundreds of kilobases distant from this
        locus. Mutations in this gene or in the enhancer regions can cause ocular
        disorders such as aniridia and Peter''s anomaly. Use of alternate promoters
        and alternative splicing results in multiple ...


        ELP4: This gene encodes a component of the six subunit elongator complex,
        a histone acetyltransferase complex that associates directly with RNA polymerase
        II during transcriptional elongation. The human gene can partially complement
        sensitivity phenotypes of yeast ELP4 deletion muta...


        DCX: This gene encodes a member of the doublecortin family. The protein encoded
        by this gene is a cytoplasmic protein and contains two doublecortin domains,
        which bind microtubules. In the developing cortex, cortical neurons must migrate
        over long distances to reach the site of their final differentiation. The
        encoded protein appears to direct neuronal migration by regulating the organization
        and stability of microtubules. In addition, the encoded protein interacts
        with LIS1, the regulatory gamma subunit of platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase,
        and this interaction is important to proper microtubule function in the developing
        cortex. Mutations in this gene c...

        with type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes exhibit re...


        LMO2: LMO2 encodes a cysteine-rich, two LIM-domain protein that is required
        for yolk sac erythropoiesis. The LMO2 protein has a central and crucial role
        in hematopoietic development and is highly conserved. The LMO2 transcription
        start site is located approximately 25 kb downstream from the 11p13 T-cell
        translocation cluster (11p13 ttc), where a ...


        NEUROG3: The protein encoded by this gene is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
        transcription factor involved in neurogenesis. The encoded protein likely
        acts as a heterodimer with another bHLH protein. D...


        GCK: This gene encodes a member of the hexokinase family of proteins. Hexokinases
        phosphorylate glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate, the first step in most
        glucose metabolism pathways. In contrast to other forms of hexokinase, this
        enzyme is not inhibited by its product glucose-6-phosphate but remains active
        while glucose is abundant. The use of multiple promoters and alternative splicing
        of this gene result in distinct protein isoforms that exhibit tissue-specific
        expression in the pancreas and liver. In the pancreas, this enzyme plays a...


        STXBP1: This gene encodes a syntaxin-binding protein. The encoded protein
        appears to play a role in release of neurotransmitters via regulation of syntaxin,
        a transmembrane attachment protein receptor. Mutations in this gene have been
        associated w...


        NKX2-2: The protein encoded by this gene contains a homeobox domain and may
        be involved in the morphogenesis of the central nervous system. This gene

        genes, including insulin, somatostatin, glucokinase, islet amyloid polypeptide,
        and glucose transporter type 2. The encoded nuclear protein is involved in
        the early development of the pancreas and plays a major role in glucose-dependent

        protein is an 18kDa subunit of the signal peptidase complex and has been linked
        to cell migration and invasion, gastric cancer and lymph node metastasis.
        Alternative spl...


        VDR: This gene encodes vitamin D3 receptor, which is a member of the nuclear
        hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors. This
        receptor also functions as a receptor for the secondary bile acid, lithocholic
        acid. Downstream targets of vitamin D3 receptor are principally involved in
        mineral metabolism, though this receptor regulates a variety of other metabolic
        pathways, such as those involved in immune response and cancer. Mutations
        in this gene are associated with type II vitamin D-resistant rickets. A single
        nucleotide polymorphism in the initiation codon results in an alternate translation
        start site three co...

        mutations or genetic variations, are the common cause of chronic hereditary...


        PAX4: This gene is a member of the paired box (PAX) family of transcription
        factors. Members of this gene family typically contain a paired box domain,
        an octapeptide, and a paired-type homeodomain. These genes play critical roles
        during fetal development and cancer growth. The paired box 4 gene is involved
        ...


        NEUROD1: This gene encodes a member of the NeuroD family of basic helix-loop-helix
        (bHLH) transcription factors. The protein forms heterodimers with other bHLH
        proteins and activates transcription of genes that contain a specific DNA
        sequence known as the E-bo...


        SRPRB: The protein encoded by this gene has similarity to mouse protein which
        is a subunit of the signal recognition particle receptor (SR). This subunit
        is a transmembrane GTPase belonging to the GTPase superfamily. It anchors
        alpha subunit, a peripheral membrane GTPase, to the...

        ISL1: This gene encodes a member of the LIM/homeodomain family of transcription
        factors. The encoded protein binds to the enhancer region of the insulin gene,
        among others, and may play an important role in regulating insulin gene expression.
        The encoded protein is central to the development of pancreatic cell linea...


        INSM1: Insulinoma-associated 1 (INSM1) gene is intronless and encodes a protein
        containing both a zinc finger DNA-binding domain and a putative prohormone
        domain. This gene is a sensi...


        PAK3: The protein encoded by this gene is a serine-threonine kinase and forms
        an activated complex with GTP-bound RAS-like (P21), CDC2 and RAC1. This protein
        may be necessary for dendritic development and for the rapid cytoskeletal
        reorganization in dendritic spines associated with synaptic plasticity. Defects
        in this gene are the cau...


        PAX6: This gene encodes paired box protein Pax-6, one of many human homologs
        of the Drosophila melanogaster gene prd. In addition to a conserved paired
        box domain, a hallmark feature of this gene family, the encoded protein also
        contains a homeobox domain. Both domains are known to bind DNA and function
        as regulators of gene transcription. Activity of this protein is key in the
        development of neural tissues, particularly the eye. This gene is regulated
        by multiple enhancers located up to hundreds of kilobases distant from this
        locus. Mutations in this gene or in the enhancer regions can cause ocular
        disorders such as aniridia and Peter''s anomaly. Use of alternate promoters
        and alternative splicing results in multiple ...


        ELP4: This gene encodes a component of the six subunit elongator complex,
        a histone acetyltransferase complex that associates directly with RNA polymerase
        II during transcriptional elongation. The human gene can partially complement
        sensitivity phenotypes of yeast ELP4 deletion muta...


        DCX: This gene encodes a member of the doublecortin family. The protein encoded
        by this gene is a cytoplasmic protein and contains two doublecortin domains,
        which bind microtubules. In the developing cortex, cortical neurons must migrate
        over long distances to reach the site of their final differentiation. The
        encoded protein appears to direct neuronal migration by regulating the organization
        and stability of microtubules. In addition, the encoded protein interacts
        with LIS1, the regulatory gamma subunit of platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase,
        and this interaction is important to proper microtubule function in the developing
        cortex. Mutations in this gene c...


        IAPP: This gene encodes a member of the calcitonin family of peptide hormones.
        This hormone is released from pancreatic beta cells following food intake
        to regulate blood glucose levels and act as a satiation signal. Human patients
        with type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes exhibit re...


        LMO2: LMO2 encodes a cysteine-rich, two LIM-domain protein that is required
        for yolk sac erythropoiesis. The LMO2 protein has a central and crucial role
        in hematopoietic development and is highly conserved. The LMO2 transcription
        start site is located approximately 25 kb downstream from the 11p13 T-cell
        translocation cluster (11p13 ttc), where a ...


        NEUROG3: The protein encoded by this gene is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
        transcription factor involved in neurogenesis. The encoded protein likely
        acts as a heterodimer with another bHLH protein. D...


        GCK: This gene encodes a member of the hexokinase family of proteins. Hexokinases
        phosphorylate glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate, the first step in most
        glucose metabolism pathways. In contrast to other forms of hexokinase, this
        enzyme is not inhibited by its product glucose-6-phosphate but remains active
        while glucose is abundant. The use of multiple promoters and alternative splicing
        of this gene result in distinct protein isoforms that exhibit tissue-specific
        expression in the pancreas and liver. In the pancreas, this enzyme plays a...


        STXBP1: This gene encodes a syntaxin-binding protein. The encoded protein
        appears to play a role in release of neurotransmitters via regulation of syntaxin,
        a transmembrane attachment protein receptor. Mutations in this gene have been
        associated w...


        NKX2-2: The protein encoded by this gene contains a homeobox domain and may
        be involved in the morphogenesis of the central nervous system. This gene
        is found on chromosome 20 near NKX2-4, and these two genes appear to be duplicated
        on chromosome...


        PDX1: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional activator of several
        genes, including insulin, somatostatin, glucokinase, islet amyloid polypeptide,
        and glucose transporter type 2. The encoded nuclear protein is involved in
        the early development of the pancreas and plays a major role in glucose-dependent
        regulation of insulin gene expression. Defects in this g...


        SST: The hormone somatostatin has active 14 aa and 28 aa forms that are produced
        by alternate cleavage of the single preproprotein encoded by this gene. Somatostatin
        is expressed throughout the body and inhibits the release of numerous secondary
        hormones by binding to high-affinity G-protein-coupled somatostatin receptors.
        This hormone is an important regulator of the endocrine system through its
        interactions with pituitary growth hormone, ...


        PCSK1: This gene encodes a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase
        family, which includes proteases that process protein and peptide precursors
        trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway.

        Family members have an extracellular N-terminal transmembrane domain and a
        cytoplasmic C terminus with two tandem C2 domains (C2A and C2B). Synaptotogmin
        family members can form homo- and heteromeric complexes with each other. They
        also have different biochemical properties and developmental profiles, and
        patterns of tissue distributio...


        ABCC8: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of
        ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules
        across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven

        are characterized by a distinct forkhead domain.  The specific function of
        this gene has not yet been determined; however, it may play a role in myogenic
        growth and d...


        SEC11A: This gene encodes a member of the peptidase S26B family. The encoded
        protein is an 18kDa subunit of the signal peptidase complex and has been linked
        to cell migration and invasion, gastric cancer and lymph node metastasis.
        Alternative spl...


        VDR: This gene encodes vitamin D3 receptor, which is a member of the nuclear
        hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors. This
        receptor also functions as a receptor for the secondary bile acid, lithocholic
        acid. Downstream targets of vitamin D3 receptor are principally involved in
        mineral metabolism, though this receptor regulates a variety of other metabolic
        pathways, such as those involved in immune response and cancer. Mutations
        in this gene are associated with type II vitamin D-resistant rickets. A single
        nucleotide polymorphism in the initiation codon results in an alternate translation
        start site three co...


        FOXA2: This gene encodes a member of the forkhead class of DNA-binding proteins.
        These hepatocyte nuclear factors are transcriptional activators for liver-specific
        genes such as albumin and transthyretin, and they also interact with chromatin.
        Similar family members in mice have roles in the regulation of metabolism
        and in the differentiation of the pancreas and li...


        SLC2A2: This gene encodes an integral plasma membrane glycoprotein of the
        liver, islet beta cells, intestine, and kidney epithelium. The encoded protein
        mediates facilitated bidirectional glucose transport. Because of its low affinity
        for glucose, it has been suggested as a glucose sensor. Mutations in this
        gene are associated with susceptibility to dise...


        MAFB: The protein encoded by this gene is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription
        factor that plays an important role in the regulation of lineage-specific
        hematopoiesis. The encoded nuclear protein represses ETS1-mediat...
