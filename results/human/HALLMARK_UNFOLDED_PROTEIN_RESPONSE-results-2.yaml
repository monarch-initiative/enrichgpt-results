        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Mechanism: These genes encode proteins that play a role in protein synthesis,
        cellular trafficking, conformational folding, and RNA binding. These processes
        are inter-related in that conformational folding is necessary for protein
        structure, protein expression is required for protein synthesis, and RNA binding
        is necessary for mRNA translation. The endoplasmic reticulum stress response
        allows for regulation of these processes.
