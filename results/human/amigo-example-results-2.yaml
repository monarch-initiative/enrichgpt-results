        reduces the amount of thrombin ...


        TIMP1: This gene belongs to the TIMP gene family. The proteins encoded by
        this gene family are natural inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
        a group of peptidases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        In addition to its inhibitory role against most of the known MMPs, the encoded
        protein is able to promote cell proliferation in a wide range of cell types,
        and may also have an anti-apoptotic function. Transcription of this gene is
        highly inducible in response to many cytokines and ho...


        TNFRSF21: This gene encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor
        superfamily. The encoded protein activates nuclear factor kappa-B and mitogen-activated
        protein kinase 8 (also called c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1), and induces cell
        apoptosis. Through its death domain, the encoded receptor interacts with tumor
        necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated death domain (TRADD) protein, which
        is known to mediate sign...


        VAV2: VAV2 is the second member of the VAV guanine nucleotide exchange factor
        family of oncogenes. Unlike VAV1, which is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic
        cells, VAV2 transcripts were found in most tissues. Alternati...

        component of the extracellular matrix. This protein is involved in cell adhesion,
        proliferation, proliferation, migration and angiogenesis and plays a central
        role in tissue morphogenesis and ma...


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expr...


        VTN: The protein encoded by this gene functions in part as an adhesive glycoprotein.
        Differential expression of this protein can promote either cell adhesion or
        migration as it links cells to the extracellular matrix through a variety
        of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1,
        and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be
        present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular
        matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging
        effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpin
        serine protease inhibitors. This protein can also promote extracellular matrix
        degr...

        proliferation, proliferation, migration and angiogenesis and plays a central
        role in tissue morphogenesis and ma...


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expr...


        VTN: The protein encoded by this gene functions in part as an adhesive glycoprotein.
        Differential expression of this protein can promote either cell adhesion or
        migration as it links cells to the extracellular matrix through a variety
        of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1,
        and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be
        present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular
        matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging
        effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpin
        serine protease inhibitors. This protein can also promote extracellular matrix
        degr...

        type I membrane receptor that binds thrombin. This binding results in the
        activation of protein C, which degrades clotting factors Va and VIIIa and
        reduces the amount of thrombin ...


        TIMP1: This gene belongs to the TIMP gene family. The proteins encoded by
        this gene family are natural inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
        a group of peptidases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        In addition to its inhibitory role against most of the known MMPs, the encoded
        protein is able to promote cell proliferation in a wide range of cell types,
        and may also have an anti-apoptotic function. Transcription of this gene is
        highly inducible in response to many cytokines and ho...


        TNFRSF21: This gene encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor
        superfamily. The encoded protein activates nuclear factor kappa-B and mitogen-activated
        protein kinase 8 (also called c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1), and induces cell
        apoptosis. Through its death domain, the encoded receptor interacts with tumor
        necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated death domain (TRADD) protein, which
        is known to mediate sign...


        VAV2: VAV2 is the second member of the VAV guanine nucleotide exchange factor
        family of oncogenes. Unlike VAV1, which is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic
        cells, VAV2 transcripts were found in most tissues. Alternati...


        VCAN: This gene is a member of the aggrecan/versican proteoglycan family.
        The protein encoded is a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan and is a major
        component of the extracellular matrix. This protein is involved in cell adhesion,
        proliferation, proliferation, migration and angiogenesis and plays a central
        role in tissue morphogenesis and ma...


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expr...


        VTN: The protein encoded by this gene functions in part as an adhesive glycoprotein.
        Differential expression of this protein can promote either cell adhesion or
        migration as it links cells to the extracellular matrix through a variety
        of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1,
        and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be
        present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular
        matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging
        effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpin
        serine protease inhibitors. This protein can also promote extracellular matrix
        degr...

        Mechanism: Extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and remodeling, cell adhesion,
        and angiogenesis are essential processes in tissue development, maintenance,
        and repair. Dysregulation of these processes can lead to pathological conditions
        such as cancer and fibrosis.


        Enriched terms: extracellular matrix organization; cell adhesion; angiogenesis;
        cell migration; regulation of cell migration; positive regulation of cell
        proliferation; positive regulation of MAPK cascade.


        Hypothesis: These genes are likely involved in a common biological pathway
        that regulates ECM organization, cell adhesion, and angiogenesis. One possible
        mechanism is the activation of MAPK signaling, which plays a central role
        in cell migration, proliferation, and survival, and is often dysregulated

        APBB1/TIP60 to promote transcriptional activation, while others form the protein
        basis of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer
        disease. In addition, two of the peptides are antimicrobial peptides, having

        of circulating plasma lipoproteins. It has been implicated in a variety of
        physiologic pathways including lipoprotein metabolism, coagulation, hemostasis,
        and the production of antiphospholipid autoantibodies. APOH may be a required
        cofactor for anionic phospholipid binding by the antiphospholipid autoantibodies
        found in sera of many patients with lupus and primary antiphospholipid syndrome
        (APS). The anti-beta (2) glycoprotein I antibodies from APS patients, mediate

        of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1,
        and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be
        present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular
        matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging
        effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpin
        serine protease inhibitors. This protein can also promote extracellular matrix
        degradation and thus plays a role in tumorigenesis. It is involved in a variety
        of other biological processes such as the regulation of the coagulation pathway,
        wound healing, and ti...


        TIMP1: This gene belongs to the TIMP gene family. The proteins encoded by
        this gene family are natural inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
        a group of peptidases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        In addition to its inhibitory role against most of the known MMPs, the encoded
        protein is able to promote cell proliferation in a wide range of cell types,
        and may also have an anti-apoptotic function. Transcription of this gene is
        highly inducible in response to many cytokines and hormones. In addition,
        the expression from some but not all inactive X chromosomes suggests that
        this gene inactivation is polymor...


        ITGAV: The product of this gene belongs to the integrin alpha chain family.
        Integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha

        family that includes decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, keratocan, epiphycan,
        and osteoglycin. In these bifunctional molecules, the protein moiety binds
        collagen fibrils and the highly charged hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans regulate
        interfibrillar spacings. Lumican is the major keratan sulfate proteoglycan
        of the cornea but is also distributed in interstitial collagenous matrices
        throughout the body. Lumican may regulate collagen fibril organizatio...


        PF4: This gene encodes a member of the CXC chemokine family. This chemokine
        is released from the alpha granules of activated platelets in the form of
        a homotetramer which has high affinity for heparin and is involved in platelet

        syndrome type I...


        STC1: This gene encodes a secreted, homodimeric glycoprotein that is expressed
        in a wide variety of tissues and may have autocrine or paracrine functions.
        The gene contains a 5'' UTR rich in CAG trinucleotide repeats. The encoded
        protein contains 11 conserved cysteine residues and is phosphorylated by protein
        kinase C exclusively on its serine residues. The protein may play a role in
        the regulation of renal and intestinal calcium and phosphate transport, cell
        metabolism, or cellular calcium/phosphate homeostasis. Overexpression of human
        stanniocalcin 1 in mice produces high serum phosphate levels, d...


        KCNJ8: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they
        participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded
        by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium
        channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium
        to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins.
        Defects in this gene may b...


        MSX1: This gene encodes a member of the muscle segment homeobox gene family.
        The encoded protein functions as a transcriptional repressor during embryogenesis
        through interactions with components of the core transcription complex and
        other homeoproteins. It may also have roles in limb-pattern formation, craniofacial
        development, particularly odontogenesis, and tumor growth inhibition. Mutations
        in this gene, which was once known as homeobox 7, have been associated with
        nonsyndromic cleft lip with or witho...


        PTK2: This gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase which is found
        concentrated in the focal adhesions that form between cells growing in the
        presence of extracellular matrix constituents. The encoded protein is a member
        of the FAK subfamily of protein tyrosine kinases but lacks significant sequence
        similarity to kinases from other subfamilies. Activation of this gene may
        be an important early step in cell growth and intracellular signal transduction
        pathways triggered in response to certain neural peptides or to cell interactions
        with the e...


        PRG2: The protein encoded by this gene is the predominant constituent of the
        crystalline core of the eosinophil granule. High levels of the proform of
        this protein are also present in placenta and pregnancy serum, where it exists
        as a complex with several other proteins including pregnancy-associated plasma
        protein A (PAPPA), angiotensinogen (AGT), and C3dg. This protein may be involved
        in antiparasitic defense mechanisms as a cytotoxin and helminthotoxin, and
        in immune hypersensitivity reactions. The encoded protein contains a peptide
        that displays potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria,
        Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. It is directly implicated in epithelial
        cell damage, exfoli...


        PDGFA: This gene encodes a member of the protein family comprised of both
        platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factors
        (VEGF). The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate
        platelet-derived growth factor subunit A, which can homodimerize, or alternatively,
        heterodimerize with the related platelet-derived growth factor subunit B.
        These proteins bind and activate PDGF receptor tyrosine kinases, which play
        a role in a wide range ...


        SERPINA5: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the serpin family
        of proteins, a group of proteins that inhibit serine proteases. This gene
        is one in a cluster of serpin genes located on the q arm of chromosome 14.
        This family member is a glycoprotein that can inhibit several serine proteases,
        including protein C and various plasminogen activators and kallikreins, and
        it thus pla...


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expression of some isoforms derived from the AUG start
        codon is regulated by a small upstream open reading frame, which is located
        within an internal ribosome entry site. The levels of VEGF are increased during
        infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
        thus promoti...

        protein. It contains an FS module, a follistatin-like sequence containing
        10 conserved cysteine residues. This gene product is thought to be an autoantigen
        associa...


        NRP1: This gene encodes one of two neuropilins, which contain specific protein
        domains which allow them to participate in several different types of signaling
        pathways that control cell migration. Neuropilins contain a large N-terminal
        extracellular domain, made up of complement-binding, coagulation factor V/VIII,
        and meprin domains. These proteins also contains a short membrane-spanning
        domain and a small cytoplasmic domain. Neuropilins bind many ligands and various
        types of co-receptors; they affect cell survival, migration, and attraction.
        Some of the ligands and co-receptors bound by neuropilins are vascular endothelial
        growth factor (VEGF) and semaphorin fa...


        S100A4: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the S100 family of
        proteins containing 2 EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. S100 proteins are localized
        in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, and involved in
        the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression
        and differentiation. S100 genes include at least 13 members which are located
        as a cluster on chromosome 1q21. This protein may function in motility, invasion,
        and tubulin polymerization. Chromosomal rearrangements and altered expression
        of this gene have been implicat...


        LRPAP1: This gene encodes a protein that interacts with the low density lipoprotein
        (LDL) receptor-related protein and facilitates its proper folding and localization
        by preventing the binding of ligands. Mutations in this gene have been identified
        in individuals with myopia 23. Alternative splicin...


        VTN: The protein encoded by this gene functions in part as an adhesive glycoprotein.
        Differential expression of this protein can promote either cell adhesion or
        migration as it links cells to the extracellular matrix through a variety
        of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1,
        and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be
        present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular
        matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging
        effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpin
        serine protease inhibitors. This protein can also promote extracellular matrix
        degradation and thus plays a role in tumorigenesis. It is involved in a variety
        of other biological processes such as the regulation of the coagulation pathway,
        wound healing, and ti...


        TIMP1: This gene belongs to the TIMP gene family. The proteins encoded by
        this gene family are natural inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
        a group of peptidases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        In addition to its inhibitory role against most of the known MMPs, the encoded
        protein is able to promote cell proliferation in a wide range of cell types,
        and may also have an anti-apoptotic function. Transcription of this gene is
        highly inducible in response to many cytokines and hormones. In addition,
        the expression from some but not all inactive X chromosomes suggests that
        this gene inactivation is polymor...


        ITGAV: The product of this gene belongs to the integrin alpha chain family.
        Integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha
        subunit and a beta subunit that function in cell surface adhesion and signaling.
        The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate light and
        heavy chains that comprise the alpha V subunit. This subunit associates with
        beta 1, beta 3, beta 5, beta 6 and beta 8 subunits. The heterodimer consisting
        of alpha V and beta 3 subunits is also known as the vitronectin receptor.
        This integrin may regulate angiogenesis and cancer progression. Alternative
        splicing result...


        LUM: This gene encodes a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP)
        family that includes decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, keratocan, epiphycan,
        and osteoglycin. In these bifunctional molecules, the protein moiety binds
        collagen fibrils and the highly charged hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans regulate
        interfibrillar spacings. Lumican is the major keratan sulfate proteoglycan
        of the cornea but is also distributed in interstitial collagenous matrices
        throughout the body. Lumican may regulate collagen fibril organizatio...


        PF4: This gene encodes a member of the CXC chemokine family. This chemokine
        is released from the alpha granules of activated platelets in the form of
        a homotetramer which has high affinity for heparin and is involved in platelet
        aggregation. This protein is chemotactic for numerous other cell type and
        also functions as an inhibitor of hematopoiesis, angiogenesis and T-cell function.
        The protein...


        CXCL6: The protein encoded by this gene is a member CXC chemokine family.
        The encoded protein is a chemotactic for neutrophil granulocytes and has antibacterial
        action against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. This gene and other
        members of the CXC chemokine gene family form a ge...


        COL3A1: This gene encodes the pro-alpha1 chains of type III collagen, a fibrillar
        collagen that is found in extensible connective tissues such as skin, lung,
        uterus, intestine and the vascular system, frequently in association with
        type I collagen. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos
        syndrome type I...


        STC1: This gene encodes a secreted, homodimeric glycoprotein that is expressed
        in a wide variety of tissues and may have autocrine or paracrine functions.
        The gene contains a 5'' UTR rich in CAG trinucleotide repeats. The encoded
        protein contains 11 conserved cysteine residues and is phosphorylated by protein
        kinase C exclusively on its serine residues. The protein may play a role in
        the regulation of renal and intestinal calcium and phosphate transport, cell
        metabolism, or cellular calcium/phosphate homeostasis. Overexpression of human
        stanniocalcin 1 in mice produces high serum phosphate levels, d...


        KCNJ8: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they
        participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded
        by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium
        channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium
        to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins.
        Defects in this gene may b...


        MSX1: This gene encodes a member of the muscle segment homeobox gene family.
        The encoded protein functions as a transcriptional repressor during embryogenesis
        through interactions with components of the core transcription complex and
        other homeoproteins. It may also have roles in limb-pattern formation, craniofacial
        development, particularly odontogenesis, and tumor growth inhibition. Mutations
        in this gene, which was once known as homeobox 7, have been associated with
        nonsyndromic cleft lip with or witho...


        PTK2: This gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase which is found
        concentrated in the focal adhesions that form between cells growing in the
        presence of extracellular matrix constituents. The encoded protein is a member
        of the FAK subfamily of protein tyrosine kinases but lacks significant sequence
        similarity to kinases from other subfamilies. Activation of this gene may
        be an important early step in cell growth and intracellular signal transduction
        pathways triggered in response to certain neural peptides or to cell interactions
        with the e...


        PRG2: The protein encoded by this gene is the predominant constituent of the
        crystalline core of the eosinophil granule. High levels of the proform of
        this protein are also present in placenta and pregnancy serum, where it exists
        as a complex with several other proteins including pregnancy-associated plasma
        protein A (PAPPA), angiotensinogen (AGT), and C3dg. This protein may be involved
        in antiparasitic defense mechanisms as a cytotoxin and helminthotoxin, and
        in immune hypersensitivity reactions. The encoded protein contains a peptide
        that displays potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria,
        Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. It is directly implicated in epithelial
        cell damage, exfoli...


        PDGFA: This gene encodes a member of the protein family comprised of both
        platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factors
        (VEGF). The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate
        platelet-derived growth factor subunit A, which can homodimerize, or alternatively,
        heterodimerize with the related platelet-derived growth factor subunit B.
        These proteins bind and activate PDGF receptor tyrosine kinases, which play
        a role in a wide range ...


        SERPINA5: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the serpin family
        of proteins, a group of proteins that inhibit serine proteases. This gene
        is one in a cluster of serpin genes located on the q arm of chromosome 14.
        This family member is a glycoprotein that can inhibit several serine proteases,
        including protein C and various plasminogen activators and kallikreins, and
        it thus pla...


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expression of some isoforms derived from the AUG start
        codon is regulated by a small upstream open reading frame, which is located
        within an internal ribosome entry site. The levels of VEGF are increased during
        infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
        thus promoti...

        SERPINA5: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the serpin family
        of proteins, a group of proteins that inhibit serine proteases. This gene
        is one in a cluster of serpin genes located on the q arm of chromosome 14.
        This family member is a glycoprotein that can inhibit several serine proteases,
        including ...


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expr...
