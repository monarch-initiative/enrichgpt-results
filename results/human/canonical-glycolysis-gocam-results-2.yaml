        Here are the gene summaries:



        HK1: Hexokinases phosphorylate glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate, the
        first step in most glucose metabolism pathways. This gene encodes a ubiquitous
        form of hexokinase which localizes to the outer membrane of mitochondria.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase
        deficiency. Alternative splicing of this gene results in several transcript
        variants which encode different isoforms, some of which are tissue-specific.
        [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2016]


        GPI: This gene encodes a member of the glucose phosphate isomerase protein
        family. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein
        based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. In the
        cytoplasm, the gene product functions as a glycolytic enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate
        isomerase) that interconverts glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.
        Extracellularly, the encoded protein (also referred to as neuroleukin) functions
        as a neurotrophic factor that promotes survival of skeletal motor neurons
        and sensory neurons, and as a lymphokine that induces immunoglobulin secretion.
        The encoded protein is also referred to as autocrine motility factor based
        on an additional function as a tumor-secreted cytokine and angiogenic factor.
        Defects in this gene are the cause of nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and
        a severe enzyme deficiency can be associated with hydrops fetalis, immediate
        neonatal death and neurological impairment. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2016]


        PFKM: Three phosphofructokinase isozymes exist in humans: muscle, liver and
        platelet. These isozymes function as subunits of the mammalian tetramer phosphofructokinase,
        which catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.
        Tetramer composition varies depending on tissue type. This gene encodes the
        muscle-type isozyme. Mutations in this gene have been associated with glycogen
        storage disease type VII, also known as Tarui disease. Alternatively spliced
        transcript variants have been described.[provided by RefSeq, Nov 2009]


        ALDOA: This gene encodes a member of the class I fructose-bisphosphate aldolase
        protein family. The encoded protein is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes
        the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
        and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Three aldolase isozymes (A, B, and C), encoded
        by three different genes, are differentially expressed during development.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with Glycogen Storage Disease
        XII, an autosomal recessive disorder associated with hemolytic anemia. Disruption
        of this gene also plays a role in the progression of multiple types of cancers.
        Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 3 and 10. [provided
        by RefSeq, Sep 2017]


        TPI1: This gene encodes an enzyme, consisting of two identical proteins, which
        catalyzes the isomerization of glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxy-acetone
        phosphate (DHAP) in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Mutations in this gene
        are associated with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. Pseudogenes have
        been identified on chromosomes 1, 4, 6 and 7. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2009]


        GAPDH: This gene encodes a member of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
        protein family. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting
        protein based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions.
        The product of this gene catalyzes an important energy-yielding step in carbohydrate
        metabolism, the reversible oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
        in the presence of inorganic phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
        (NAD). The encoded protein has additionally been identified to have uracil
        DNA glycosylase activity in the nucleus. Also, this protein contains a peptide
        that has antimicrobial activity against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans.
        Studies of a similar protein in mouse have assigned a variety of additional
        functions including nitrosylation of nuclear proteins, the regulation of mRNA
        stability, and acting as a transferrin receptor on the cell surface of macrophage.
        Many pseudogenes similar to this locus are present in the human genome. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Nov
        2014]


        PGK1: The protein encoded by this gene is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes
        the conversion of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate. The encoded
        protein may also act as a cofactor for polymerase alpha. Additionally, this
        protein is secreted by tumor cells where it participates in angiogenesis by
        functioning to reduce disulfide bonds in the serine protease, plasmin, which
        consequently leads to the release of the tumor blood vessel inhibitor angiostatin.
        The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein based on
        its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. Deficiency of the
        enzyme is associated with a wide range of clinical phenotypes hemolytic anemia
        and neurological impairment. Pseudogenes of this gene have been defined on
        chromosomes 19, 21 and the X chromosome. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2014]


        PGAM2: Phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) catalyzes the reversible reaction of
        3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) to 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PGA) in the glycolytic
        pathway. The PGAM is a dimeric enzyme containing, in different tissues, different
        proportions of a slow-migrating muscle (MM) isozyme, a fast-migrating brain
        (BB) isozyme, and a hybrid form (MB). This gene encodes muscle-specific PGAM
        subunit. Mutations in this gene cause muscle phosphoglycerate mutase eficiency,
        also known as glycogen storage disease X. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]


        ENO3: This gene encodes one of the three enolase isoenzymes found in mammals.
        This isoenzyme is found in skeletal muscle cells in the adult where it may
        play a role in muscle development and regeneration. A switch from alpha enolase
        to beta enolase occurs in muscle tissue during development in rodents. Mutations
        in this gene have be associated glycogen storage disease. Alternatively spliced
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.[provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2010]


        PKM: This gene encodes a protein involved in glycolysis. The encoded protein
        is a pyruvate kinase that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphoryl group from
        phosphoenolpyruvate to ADP, generating ATP and pyruvate. This protein has
        been shown to interact with thyroid hormone and may mediate cellular metabolic
        effects induced by thyroid hormones. This protein has been found to bind Opa
        protein, a bacterial outer membrane protein involved in gonococcal adherence
        to and invasion of human cells, suggesting a role of this protein in bacterial
        pathogenesis. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding a
        few distinct isoforms have been reported. [provided by RefSeq, May 2011]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        HK1: Hexokinases phosphorylate glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate, the
        first step in most glucose metabolism pathways. This gene encodes a ubiquitous
        form of hexokinase which localizes to the outer membrane of mitochondria.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase
        deficiency. Alternative splicing of this gene results in several transcript
        variants which encode different isoforms, some of which are tissue-specific.
        [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2016]


        GPI: This gene encodes a member of the glucose phosphate isomerase protein
        family. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein
        based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. In the
        cytoplasm, the gene product functions as a glycolytic enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate
        isomerase) that interconverts glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.
        Extracellularly, the encoded protein (also referred to as neuroleukin) functions
        as a neurotrophic factor that promotes survival of skeletal motor neurons
        and sensory neurons, and as a lymphokine that induces immunoglobulin secretion.
        The encoded protein is also referred to as autocrine motility factor based
        on an additional function as a tumor-secreted cytokine and angiogenic factor.
        Defects in this gene are the cause of nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and
        a severe enzyme deficiency can be associated with hydrops fetalis, immediate
        neonatal death and neurological impairment. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2016]


        PFKM: Three phosphofructokinase isozymes exist in humans: muscle, liver and
        platelet. These isozymes function as subunits of the mammalian tetramer phosphofructokinase,
        which catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.
        Tetramer composition varies depending on tissue type. This gene encodes the
        muscle-type isozyme. Mutations in this gene have been associated with glycogen
        storage disease type VII, also known as Tarui disease. Alternatively spliced
        transcript variants have been described.[provided by RefSeq, Nov 2009]


        ALDOA: This gene encodes a member of the class I fructose-bisphosphate aldolase
        protein family. The encoded protein is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes
        the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
        and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Three aldolase isozymes (A, B, and C), encoded
        by three different genes, are differentially expressed during development.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with Glycogen Storage Disease
        XII, an autosomal recessive disorder associated with hemolytic anemia. Disruption
        of this gene also plays a role in the progression of multiple types of cancers.
        Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 3 and 10. [provided
        by RefSeq, Sep 2017]


        TPI1: This gene encodes an enzyme, consisting of two identical proteins, which
        catalyzes the isomerization of glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxy-acetone
        phosphate (DHAP) in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Mutations in this gene
        are associated with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. Pseudogenes have
        been identified on chromosomes 1, 4, 6 and 7. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2009]


        GAPDH: This gene encodes a member of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
        protein family. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting
        protein based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions.
        The product of this gene catalyzes an important energy-yielding step in carbohydrate
        metabolism, the reversible oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
        in the presence of inorganic phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
        (NAD). The encoded protein has additionally been identified to have uracil
        DNA glycosylase activity in the nucleus. Also, this protein contains a peptide
        that has antimicrobial activity against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans.
        Studies of a similar protein in mouse have assigned a variety of additional
        functions including nitrosylation of nuclear proteins, the regulation of mRNA
        stability, and acting as a transferrin receptor on the cell surface of macrophage.
        Many pseudogenes similar to this locus are present in the human genome. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Nov
        2014]


        PGK1: The protein encoded by this gene is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes
        the conversion of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate. The encoded
        protein may also act as a cofactor for polymerase alpha. Additionally, this
        protein is secreted by tumor cells where it participates in angiogenesis by

        Here are the gene summaries:



        HK1: Hexokinases phosphorylate glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate, the
        first step in most glucose metabolism pathways. This gene encodes a ubiquitous
        form of hexokinase which localizes to the outer membrane of mitochondria.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase
        deficiency. Alternative splicing of this gene results in several transcript
        variants which encode different isoforms, some of which are tissue-specific.
        [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2016]


        GPI: This gene encodes a member of the glucose phosphate isomerase protein
        family. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein
        based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. In the
        cytoplasm, the gene product functions as a glycolytic enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate
        isomerase) that interconverts glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.
        Extracellularly, the encoded protein (also referred to as neuroleukin) functions
        as a neurotrophic factor that promotes survival of skeletal motor neurons
        and sensory neurons, and as a lymphokine that induces immunoglobulin secretion.
        The encoded protein is also referred to as autocrine motility factor based
        on an additional function as a tumor-secreted cytokine and angiogenic factor.
        Defects in this gene are the cause of nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and
        a severe enzyme deficiency can be associated with hydrops fetalis, immediate
        neonatal death and neurological impairment. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2016]


        PFKM: Three phosphofructokinase isozymes exist in humans: muscle, liver and
        platelet. These isozymes function as subunits of the mammalian tetramer phosphofructokinase,
        which catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.
        Tetramer composition varies depending on tissue type. This gene encodes the
        muscle-type isozyme. Mutations in this gene have been associated with glycogen
        storage disease type VII, also known as Tarui disease. Alternatively spliced
        transcript variants have been described.[provided by RefSeq, Nov 2009]


        ALDOA: This gene encodes a member of the class I fructose-bisphosphate aldolase
        protein family. The encoded protein is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes
        the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
        and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Three aldolase isozymes (A, B, and C), encoded
        by three different genes, are differentially expressed during development.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with Glycogen Storage Disease
        XII, an autosomal recessive disorder associated with hemolytic anemia. Disruption
        of this gene also plays a role in the progression of multiple types of cancers.
        Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 3 and 10. [provided
        by RefSeq, Sep 2017]


        TPI1: This gene encodes an enzyme, consisting of two identical proteins, which
        catalyzes the isomerization of glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxy-acetone
        phosphate (DHAP) in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Mutations in this gene
        are associated with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. Pseudogenes have
        been identified on chromosomes 1, 4, 6 and 7. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2009]


        GAPDH: This gene encodes a member of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
        protein family. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting
        protein based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions.
        The product of this gene catalyzes an important energy-yielding step in carbohydrate
        metabolism, the reversible oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
        in the presence of inorganic phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
        (NAD). The encoded protein has additionally been identified to have uracil
        DNA glycosylase activity in the nucleus. Also, this protein contains a peptide
        that has antimicrobial activity against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans.
        Studies of a similar protein in mouse have assigned a variety of additional
        functions including nitrosylation of nuclear proteins, the regulation of mRNA
        stability, and acting as a transferrin receptor on the cell surface of macrophage.
        Many pseudogenes similar to this locus are present in the human genome. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Nov
        2014]


        PGK1: The protein encoded by this gene is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes
        the conversion of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate. The encoded
        protein may also act as a cofactor for polymerase alpha. Additionally, this
        protein is secreted by tumor cells where it participates in angiogenesis by
        functioning to reduce disulfide bonds in the serine protease, plasmin, which
        consequently leads to the release of the tumor blood vessel inhibitor angiostatin.
        The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein based on
        its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. Deficiency of the
        enzyme is associated with a wide range of clinical phenotypes hemolytic anemia
        and neurological impairment. Pseudogenes of this gene have been defined on
        chromosomes 19, 21 and the X chromosome. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2014]


        PGAM2: Phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) catalyzes the reversible reaction of
        3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) to 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PGA) in the glycolytic
        pathway. The PGAM is a dimeric enzyme containing, in different tissues, different
        proportions of a slow-migrating muscle (MM) isozyme, a fast-migrating brain
        (BB) isozyme, and a hybrid form (MB). This gene encodes muscle-specific PGAM
        subunit. Mutations in this gene cause muscle phosphoglycerate mutase eficiency,
        also known as glycogen storage disease X. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]


        ENO3: This gene encodes one of the three enolase isoenzymes found in mammals.
        This isoenzyme is found in skeletal muscle cells in the adult where it may
        play a role in muscle development and regeneration. A switch from alpha enolase
        to beta enolase occurs in muscle tissue during development in rodents. Mutations
        in this gene have be associated glycogen storage disease. Alternatively spliced
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.[provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2010]


        PKM: This gene encodes a protein involved in glycolysis. The encoded protein
        is a pyruvate kinase that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphoryl group from
        phosphoenolpyruvate to ADP, generating ATP and pyruvate. This protein has
        been shown to interact with thyroid hormone and may mediate cellular metabolic
        effects induced by thyroid hormones. This protein has been found to bind Opa
        protein, a bacterial outer membrane protein involved in gonococcal adherence
        to and invasion of human cells, suggesting a role of this protein in bacterial
        pathogenesis. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding a
        few distinct isoforms have been reported. [provided by RefSeq, May 2011]

        cytoplasm, the gene product functions as a glycolytic enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate
        isomerase) that interconverts glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.
        Extracellularly, the encoded protein (also referred to as neuroleukin) functions
        as a neurotrophic factor that promotes survival of skeletal motor neurons
        and sensory neurons, and as a lymphokine that induces immunoglobulin secretion.
        The encoded protein is also referred to as autocrine motility factor based
        on an additional function as a tumor-secreted cytokine and angiogenic factor.
        Defects in this gene are the cause of nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and
        a severe enzyme deficiency can be associated with hydrops fetalis, immediate
        neonatal death and neurological impairment. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2016]


        PFKM: Three phosphofructokinase isozymes exist in humans: muscle, liver and
        platelet. These isozymes function as subunits of the mammalian tetramer phosphofructokinase,
        which catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.
        Tetramer composition varies depending on tissue type. This gene encodes the
        muscle-type isozyme. Mutations in this gene have been associated with glycogen
        storage disease type VII, also known as Tarui disease. Alternatively spliced
        transcript variants have been described.[provided by RefSeq, Nov 2009]


        ALDOA: This gene encodes a member of the class I fructose-bisphosphate aldolase
        protein family. The encoded protein is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes
        the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
        and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Three aldolase isozymes (A, B, and C), encoded
        by three different genes, are differentially expressed during development.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with Glycogen Storage Disease
        XII, an autosomal recessive disorder associated with hemolytic anemia. Disruption
        of this gene also plays a role in the progression of multiple types of cancers.
        Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 3 and 10. [provided
        by RefSeq, Sep 2017]


        TPI1: This gene encodes an enzyme, consisting of two identical proteins, which
        catalyzes the isomerization of glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxy-acetone
        phosphate (DHAP) in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Mutations in this gene
        are associated with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. Pseudogenes have
        been identified on chromosomes 1, 4, 6 and 7. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2009]


        GAPDH: This gene encodes a member of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
        protein family. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting
        protein based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions.
        The product of this gene catalyzes an important energy-yielding step in carbohydrate
        metabolism, the reversible oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
        in the presence of inorganic phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
        (NAD). The encoded protein has additionally been identified to have uracil
        DNA glycosylase activity in the nucleus. Also, this protein contains a peptide
        that has antimicrobial activity against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans.
        Studies of a similar protein in mouse have assigned a variety of additional
        functions including nitrosylation of nuclear proteins, the regulation of mRNA
        stability, and acting as a transferrin receptor on the cell surface of macrophage.
        Many pseudogenes similar to this locus are present in the human genome. Alternative
        splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Nov

        PGK1: The protein encoded by this gene is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes
        the conversion of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate. The encoded
        protein may also act as a cofactor for polymerase alpha. Additionally, this
        protein is secreted by tumor cells where it participates in angiogenesis by
        functioning to reduce disulfide bonds in the serine protease, plasmin, which
        consequently leads to the release of the tumor blood vessel inhibitor angiostatin.
        The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein based on
        its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. Deficiency of the
        enzyme is associated with a wide range of clinical phenotypes hemolytic anemia
        and neurological impairment. Pseudogenes of this gene have been defined on
        chromosomes 19, 21 and the X chromosome. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2014]


        PGAM2: Phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) catalyzes the reversible reaction of
        3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) to 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PGA) in the glycolytic
        pathway. The PGAM is a dimeric enzyme containing, in different tissues, different
        proportions of a slow-migrating muscle (MM) isozyme, a fast-migrating brain
        (BB) isozyme, and a hybrid form (MB). This gene encodes muscle-specific PGAM
        subunit. Mutations in this gene cause muscle phosphoglycerate mutase eficiency,
        also known as glycogen storage disease X. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]


        ENO3: This gene encodes one of the three enolase isoenzymes found in mammals.
        This isoenzyme is found in skeletal muscle cells in the adult where it may
        play a role in muscle development and regeneration. A switch from alpha enolase
        to beta enolase occurs in muscle tissue during development in rodents. Mutations
        in this gene have be associated glycogen storage disease. Alternatively spliced
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.[provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2010]


        PKM: This gene encodes a protein involved in glycolysis. The encoded protein
        is a pyruvate kinase that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphoryl group from
        phosphoenolpyruvate to ADP, generating ATP and pyruvate. This protein has
        been shown to interact with thyroid hormone and may mediate cellular metabolic
        effects induced by thyroid hormones. This protein has been found to bind Opa
        protein, a bacterial outer membrane protein involved in gonococcal adherence
        to and invasion of human cells, suggesting a role of this protein in bacterial
        pathogenesis. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding a
        few distinct isoforms have been reported. [provided by RefSeq, May 2011]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        ENO3: This gene encodes one of the three enolase isoenzymes found in mammals.
        This isoenzyme is found in skeletal muscle cells in the adult where it may
        play a role in muscle development and regeneration. A switch from alpha enolase
        to beta enolase occurs in muscle tissue during development in rodents. Mutations
        in this gene have be associated glycogen storage disease. Alternatively spliced
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.[provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2010]


        ALDOA: This gene encodes a member of the class I fructose-bisphosphate aldolase
        protein family. The encoded protein is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes
        the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
        and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Three aldolase isozymes (A, B, and C), encoded
        by three different genes, are differentially expressed during development.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with Glycogen Storage Disease
        XII, an autosomal recessive disorder associated with hemolytic anemia. Disruption
        of this gene also plays a role in the progression of multiple types of cancers.
        Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 3 and 10. [provided
        by RefSeq, Sep 2017]


        PGK1: The protein encoded by this gene is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes
        the conversion of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate. The encoded
        protein may also act as a cofactor for polymerase alpha. Additionally, this
        protein is secreted by tumor cells where it participates in angiogenesis by
        functioning to reduce disulfide bonds in the serine protease, plasmin, which
        consequently leads to the release of the tumor blood vessel inhibitor angiostatin.
        The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein based on
        its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. Deficiency of the
        enzyme is associated with a wide range of clinical phenotypes hemolytic anemia
        and neurological impairment. Pseudogenes of this gene have been defined on
        chromosomes 19, 21 and the X chromosome. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2014]


        PGAM2: Phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) catalyzes the reversible reaction of
        3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) to 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PGA) in the glycolytic
        pathway. The PGAM is a dimeric enzyme containing, in different tissues, different
        proportions of a slow-migrating muscle (MM) isozyme, a fast-migrating brain
        (BB) isozyme, and a hybrid form (MB). This gene encodes muscle-specific PGAM
        subunit. Mutations in this gene cause muscle phosphoglycerate mutase eficiency,
        also known as glycogen storage disease X. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]


        HK1: Hexokinases phosphorylate glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate, the
        first step in most glucose metabolism pathways. This gene encodes a ubiquitous
        form of hexokinase which localizes to the outer membrane of mitochondria.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase
        deficiency. Alternative splicing of this gene results in several transcript
        variants which encode different isoforms, some of which are tissue-specific.
        [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2016]


        PFKM: Three phosphofructokinase isozymes exist in humans: muscle, liver and
        platelet. These isozymes function as subunits of the mammalian tetramer phosphofructokinase,
        which catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.
        Tetramer composition varies depending on tissue type. This gene encodes the
        muscle-type isozyme. Mutations in this gene have been associated with glycogen
        storage disease type VII, also known as Tarui disease. Alternatively spliced
        transcript variants have been described.[provided by RefSeq, Nov 2009]


        PKM: This gene encodes a protein involved in glycolysis. The encoded protein
        is a pyruvate kinase that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphoryl group from
        phosphoenolpyruvate to ADP, generating ATP and pyruvate. This protein has
        been shown to interact with thyroid hormone and may mediate cellular metabolic
        effects induced by thyroid hormones. This protein has been found to bind Opa
        protein, a bacterial outer membrane protein involved in gonococcal adherence
        to and invasion of human cells, suggesting a role of this protein in bacterial
        pathogenesis. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding a
        few distinct isoforms have been reported. [provided by RefSeq, May 2011]


        TPI1: This gene encodes an enzyme, consisting of two identical proteins, which
        catalyzes the isomerization of glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxy-acetone
        phosphate (DHAP) in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Mutations in this gene
        are associated with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. Pseudogenes have
        been identified on chromosomes 1, 4, 6 and 7. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2009]


        GPI: This gene encodes a member of the glucose phosphate isomerase protein
        family. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein
        based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. In the
        cytoplasm, the gene product functions as a glycolytic enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate
        isomerase) that interconverts glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.
        Extracellularly, the encoded protein (also referred to as neuroleukin) functions
        as a neurotrophic factor that promotes survival of skeletal motor neurons
        and sensory neurons, and as a lymphokine that induces immunoglobulin secretion.
        The encoded protein is also referred to as autocrine motility factor based
        on an additional function as a tumor-secreted cytokine and angiogenic factor.
        Defects in this gene are the cause of nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and
        a severe enzyme deficiency can be associated with hydrops fetalis, immediate
        neonatal death and neurological impairment. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2016]

        effects induced by thyroid hormones. This protein has been found to bind Opa
        protein, a bacterial outer membrane protein involved in gonococcal adherence
        to and invasion of human cells, suggesting a role of this protein in bacterial
        pathogenesis. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding a
        few distinct isoforms have been reported. [provided by RefSeq, May 2011]


        TPI1: This gene encodes an enzyme, consisting of two identical proteins, which
        catalyzes the isomerization of glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxy-acetone
        phosphate (DHAP) in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Mutations in this gene
        are associated with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. Pseudogenes have
        been identified on chromosomes 1, 4, 6 and 7. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2009]


        GPI: This gene encodes a member of the glucose phosphate isomerase protein
        family. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein
        based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. In the
        cytoplasm, the gene product functions as a glycolytic enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate
        isomerase) that interconverts glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.
        Extracellularly, the encoded protein (also referred to as neuroleukin) functions
        as a neurotrophic factor that promotes survival of skeletal motor neurons
        and sensory neurons, and as a lymphokine that induces immunoglobulin secretion.
        The encoded protein is also referred to as autocrine motility factor based
        on an additional function as a tumor-secreted cytokine and angiogenic factor.
        Defects in this gene are the cause of nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and
        a severe enzyme deficiency can be associated with hydrops fetalis, immediate
        neonatal death and neurological impairment. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2016]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        ENO3: This gene encodes one of the three enolase isoenzymes found in mammals.
        This isoenzyme is found in skeletal muscle cells in the adult where it may
        play a role in muscle development and regeneration. A switch from alpha enolase
        to beta enolase occurs in muscle tissue during development in rodents. Mutations
        in this gene have be associated glycogen storage disease. Alternatively spliced
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.[provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2010]


        ALDOA: This gene encodes a member of the class I fructose-bisphosphate aldolase
        protein family. The encoded protein is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes
        the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
        and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Three aldolase isozymes (A, B, and C), encoded
        by three different genes, are differentially expressed during development.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with Glycogen Storage Disease
        XII, an autosomal recessive disorder associated with hemolytic anemia. Disruption
        of this gene also plays a role in the progression of multiple types of cancers.
        Related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 3 and 10. [provided
        by RefSeq, Sep 2017]


        PGK1: The protein encoded by this gene is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes
        the conversion of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate. The encoded
        protein may also act as a cofactor for polymerase alpha. Additionally, this
        protein is secreted by tumor cells where it participates in angiogenesis by
        functioning to reduce disulfide bonds in the serine protease, plasmin, which
        consequently leads to the release of the tumor blood vessel inhibitor angiostatin.
        The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein based on
        its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. Deficiency of the
        enzyme is associated with a wide range of clinical phenotypes hemolytic anemia
        and neurological impairment. Pseudogenes of this gene have been defined on
        chromosomes 19, 21 and the X chromosome. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2014]


        PGAM2: Phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) catalyzes the reversible reaction of
        3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) to 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PGA) in the glycolytic
        pathway. The PGAM is a dimeric enzyme containing, in different tissues, different
        proportions of a slow-migrating muscle (MM) isozyme, a fast-migrating brain
        (BB) isozyme, and a hybrid form (MB). This gene encodes muscle-specific PGAM
        subunit. Mutations in this gene cause muscle phosphoglycerate mutase eficiency,
        also known as glycogen storage disease X. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]


        HK1: Hexokinases phosphorylate glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate, the
        first step in most glucose metabolism pathways. This gene encodes a ubiquitous
        form of hexokinase which localizes to the outer membrane of mitochondria.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase
        deficiency. Alternative splicing of this gene results in several transcript
        variants which encode different isoforms, some of which are tissue-specific.
        [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2016]


        PFKM: Three phosphofructokinase isozymes exist in humans: muscle, liver and
        platelet. These isozymes function as subunits of the mammalian tetramer phosphofructokinase,
        which catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.
        Tetramer composition varies depending on tissue type. This gene encodes the
        muscle-type isozyme. Mutations in this gene have been associated with glycogen
        storage disease type VII, also known as Tarui disease. Alternatively spliced
        transcript variants have been described.[provided by RefSeq, Nov 2009]


        PKM: This gene encodes a protein involved in glycolysis. The encoded protein
        is a pyruvate kinase that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphoryl group from
        phosphoenolpyruvate to ADP, generating ATP and pyruvate. This protein has
        been shown to interact with thyroid hormone and may mediate cellular metabolic
        effects induced by thyroid hormones. This protein has been found to bind Opa
        protein, a bacterial outer membrane protein involved in gonococcal adherence
        to and invasion of human cells, suggesting a role of this protein in bacterial
        pathogenesis. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding a
        few distinct isoforms have been reported. [provided by RefSeq, May 2011]


        TPI1: This gene encodes an enzyme, consisting of two identical proteins, which
        catalyzes the isomerization of glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxy-acetone
        phosphate (DHAP) in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Mutations in this gene
        are associated with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. Pseudogenes have
        been identified on chromosomes 1, 4, 6 and 7. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2009]


        GPI: This gene encodes a member of the glucose phosphate isomerase protein
        family. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein
        based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. In the
        cytoplasm, the gene product functions as a glycolytic enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate
        isomerase) that interconverts glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.
        Extracellularly, the encoded protein (also referred to as neuroleukin) functions
        as a neurotrophic factor that promotes survival of skeletal motor neurons
        and sensory neurons, and as a lymphokine that induces immunoglobulin secretion.
        The encoded protein is also referred to as autocrine motility factor based
        on an additional function as a tumor-secreted cytokine and angiogenic factor.
        Defects in this gene are the cause of nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and
        a severe enzyme deficiency can be associated with hydrops fetalis, immediate
        neonatal death and neurological impairment. Alternative splicing results in
        multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2016]
