        Here are the gene summaries:



        AHSG: The protein encoded by this gene is a negatively-charged serum glycoprotein
        that is synthesized by hepatocytes. The encoded protein consists of two polypeptide
        chains, which are both cleaved from a proprotein encoded from a single mRNA.
        It is involved in several processes, including endocytosis, brain development,
        and the formation of bone tissue. Defects in this gene are a cause of susceptibility
        to leanness. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        CARMIL1: Involved in several processes, including actin filament network formation;
        plasma membrane bounded cell projection organization; and positive regulation
        of cellular component organization. Located in several cellular components,
        including lamellipodium; macropinosome; and nuclear speck. [provided by Alliance
        of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        DNM2: Dynamins represent one of the subfamilies of GTP-binding proteins. These
        proteins share considerable sequence similarity over the N-terminal portion
        of the molecule, which contains the GTPase domain. Dynamins are associated
        with microtubules. They have been implicated in cell processes such as endocytosis
        and cell motility, and in alterations of the membrane that accompany certain
        activities such as bone resorption by osteoclasts. Dynamins bind many proteins
        that bind actin and other cytoskeletal proteins. Dynamins can also self-assemble,
        a process that stimulates GTPase activity. Five alternatively spliced transcripts
        encoding different proteins have been described. Additional alternatively
        spliced transcripts may exist, but their full-length nature has not been determined.
        [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2010]


        DOCK2: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the CDM protein family.
        It is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells and is predominantly expressed
        in peripheral blood leukocytes. The protein is involved in remodeling of the
        actin cytoskeleton required for lymphocyte migration in response to chemokine
        signaling. It activates members of the Rho family of GTPases, for example
        RAC1 and RAC2, by acting as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to
        exchange bound GDP for free GTP. Mutations in this gene result in immunodeficiency
        40 (IMD40), a combined form of immunodeficiency that affects T cell number
        and function, also with variable defects in B cell and NK cell function. [provided
        by RefSeq, May 2018]


        EHD4: Enables cadherin binding activity. Involved in endocytic recycling and
        protein homooligomerization. Located in endoplasmic reticulum and recycling
        endosome membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        MAPKAPK2: This gene encodes a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
        This kinase is regulated through direct phosphorylation by p38 MAP kinase.
        In conjunction with p38 MAP kinase, this kinase is known to be involved in
        many cellular processes including stress and inflammatory responses, nuclear
        export, gene expression regulation and cell proliferation. Heat shock protein
        HSP27 was shown to be one of the substrates of this kinase in vivo. Two transcript
        variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        MAPKAPK3: This gene encodes a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
        This kinase functions as a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase)-
        activated protein kinase. MAP kinases are also known as extracellular signal-regulated
        kinases (ERKs), act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals.
        This kinase was shown to be activated by growth inducers and stress stimulation
        of cells. In vitro studies demonstrated that ERK, p38 MAP kinase and Jun N-terminal
        kinase were all able to phosphorylate and activate this kinase, which suggested
        the role of this kinase as an integrative element of signaling in both mitogen
        and stress responses. This kinase was reported to interact with, phosphorylate
        and repress the activity of E47, which is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription
        factor known to be involved in the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression
        and cell differentiation. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants that encode the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2011]


        PPT1: The protein encoded by this gene is a small glycoprotein involved in
        the catabolism of lipid-modified proteins during lysosomal degradation. The
        encoded enzyme removes thioester-linked fatty acyl groups such as palmitate
        from cysteine residues. Defects in this gene are a cause of infantile neuronal
        ceroid lipofuscinosis 1 (CLN1, or INCL) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis
        4 (CLN4). Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found
        for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2008]


        PYCARD: This gene encodes an adaptor protein that is composed of two protein-protein
        interaction domains: a N-terminal PYRIN-PAAD-DAPIN domain (PYD) and a C-terminal
        caspase-recruitment domain (CARD). The PYD and CARD domains are members of
        the six-helix bundle death domain-fold superfamily that mediates assembly
        of large signaling complexes in the inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathways
        via the activation of caspase. In normal cells, this protein is localized
        to the cytoplasm; however, in cells undergoing apoptosis, it forms ball-like
        aggregates near the nuclear periphery. Two transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        RAB34: This gene encodes a protein belonging to the RAB family of proteins,
        which are small GTPases involved in protein transport. This family member
        is a Golgi-bound member of the secretory pathway that is involved in the repositioning
        of lysosomes and the activation of macropinocytosis. Alternative splicing
        of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. An alternatively spliced
        transcript variant produces the nine-amino acid residue-repeats (NARR) protein,
        which is a functionally distinct nucleolar protein resulting from a different
        reading frame. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2016]


        SNX33: The protein encoded by this gene is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization,
        vesicle trafficking, endocytosis, and mitosis. The encoded protein is essential
        for the creation of the cleavage furrow during mitosis and for completion
        of mitosis. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been
        found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2015]


        SNX5: This gene encodes a member of the sorting nexin family. Members of this
        family contain a phox (PX) domain, which is a phosphoinositide binding domain,
        and are involved in intracellular trafficking. This protein functions in endosomal
        sorting, the phosphoinositide-signaling pathway, and macropinocytosis. This
        gene may play a role in the tumorigenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.
        Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]


        UBE3A: This gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, part of the ubiquitin
        protein degradation system. This imprinted gene is maternally expressed in
        brain and biallelically expressed in other tissues. Maternally inherited deletion
        of this gene causes Angelman Syndrome, characterized by severe motor and intellectual
        retardation, ataxia, hypotonia, epilepsy, absence of speech, and characteristic
        facies. The protein also interacts with the E6 protein of human papillomavirus
        types 16 and 18, resulting in ubiquitination and proteolysis of tumor protein
        p53. Alternative splicing of this gene results in three transcript variants
        encoding three isoforms with different N-termini. Additional transcript variants
        have been described, but their full length nature has not been determined.
        [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        LRP1: This gene encodes a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family
        of proteins. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed by furin
        to generate 515 kDa and 85 kDa subunits that form the mature receptor (PMID:
        8546712). This receptor is involved in several cellular processes, including
        intracellular signaling, lipid homeostasis, and clearance of apoptotic cells.
        In addition, the encoded protein is necessary for the alpha 2-macroglobulin-mediated
        clearance of secreted amyloid precursor protein and beta-amyloid, the main
        component of amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer patients. Expression of this
        gene decreases with age and has been found to be lower than controls in brain
        tissue from Alzheimer''s disease patients. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        CD36: The protein encoded by this gene is the fourth major glycoprotein of
        the platelet surface and serves as a receptor for thrombospondin in platelets
        and various cell lines. Since thrombospondins are widely distributed proteins
        involved in a variety of adhesive processes, this protein may have important
        functions as a cell adhesion molecule. It binds to collagen, thrombospondin,
        anionic phospholipids and oxidized LDL. It directly mediates cytoadherence
        of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized erythrocytes and it binds long chain
        fatty acids and may function in the transport and/or as a regulator of fatty
        acid transport. Mutations in this gene cause platelet glycoprotein deficiency.
        Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this
        gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        LDLR: The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family consists of
        cell surface proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific
        ligands. The encoded protein is normally bound at the cell membrane, where
        it binds low density lipoprotein/cholesterol and is taken into the cell. Lysosomes
        release the cholesterol, which is made available for repression of microsomal
        enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting
        step in cholesterol synthesis. At the same time, a reciprocal stimulation
        of cholesterol ester synthesis takes place. Mutations in this gene cause the
        autosomal dominant disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia. Alternate splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, May 2022]

        LRP1: This gene encodes a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family
        of proteins. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed by furin
        to generate 515 kDa and 85 kDa subunits that form the mature receptor (PMID:
        8546712). This receptor is involved in several cellular processes, including
        intracellular signaling, lipid homeostasis, and clearance of apoptotic cells.
        In addition, the encoded protein is necessary for the alpha 2-macroglobulin-mediated
        clearance of secreted amyloid precursor protein and beta-amyloid, the main
        component of amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer patients. Expression of this
        gene decreases with age and has been found to be lower than controls in brain
        tissue from Alzheimer''s disease patients. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        CD36: The protein encoded by this gene is the fourth major glycoprotein of
        the platelet surface and serves as a receptor for thrombospondin in platelets
        and various cell lines. Since thrombospondins are widely distributed proteins
        involved in a variety of adhesive processes, this protein may have important
        functions as a cell adhesion molecule. It binds to collagen, thrombospondin,
        anionic phospholipids and oxidized LDL. It directly mediates cytoadherence
        of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized erythrocytes and it binds long chain
        fatty acids and may function in the transport and/or as a regulator of fatty
        acid transport. Mutations in this gene cause platelet glycoprotein deficiency.
        Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this
        gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        LDLR: The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family consists of
        cell surface proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific
        ligands. The encoded protein is normally bound at the cell membrane, where
        it binds low density lipoprotein/cholesterol and is taken into the cell. Lysosomes
        release the cholesterol, which is made available for repression of microsomal
        enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting
        step in cholesterol synthesis. At the same time, a reciprocal stimulation
        of cholesterol ester synthesis takes place. Mutations in this gene cause the
        autosomal dominant disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia. Alternate splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, May 2022]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        AHSG: The protein encoded by this gene is a negatively-charged serum glycoprotein
        that is synthesized by hepatocytes. The encoded protein consists of two polypeptide
        chains, which are both cleaved from a proprotein encoded from a single mRNA.
        It is involved in several processes, including endocytosis, brain development,
        and the formation of bone tissue. Defects in this gene are a cause of susceptibility
        to leanness. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        CARMIL1: Involved in several processes, including actin filament network formation;
        plasma membrane bounded cell projection organization; and positive regulation
        of cellular component organization. Located in several cellular components,
        including lamellipodium; macropinosome; and nuclear speck. [provided by Alliance
        of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        DNM2: Dynamins represent one of the subfamilies of GTP-binding proteins. These
        proteins share considerable sequence similarity over the N-terminal portion
        of the molecule, which contains the GTPase domain. Dynamins are associated
        with microtubules. They have been implicated in cell processes such as endocytosis
        and cell motility, and in alterations of the membrane that accompany certain
        activities such as bone resorption by osteoclasts. Dynamins bind many proteins
        that bind actin and other cytoskeletal proteins. Dynamins can also self-assemble,
        a process that stimulates GTPase activity. Five alternatively spliced transcripts
        encoding different proteins have been described. Additional alternatively
        spliced transcripts may exist, but their full-length nature has not been determined.
        [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2010]


        DOCK2: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the CDM protein family.
        It is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells and is predominantly expressed
        in peripheral blood leukocytes. The protein is involved in remodeling of the
        actin cytoskeleton required for lymphocyte migration in response to chemokine
        signaling. It activates members of the Rho family of GTPases, for example
        RAC1 and RAC2, by acting as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to
        exchange bound GDP for free GTP. Mutations in this gene result in immunodeficiency
        40 (IMD40), a combined form of immunodeficiency that affects T cell number
        and function, also with variable defects in B cell and NK cell function. [provided
        by RefSeq, May 2018]


        EHD4: Enables cadherin binding activity. Involved in endocytic recycling and
        protein homooligomerization. Located in endoplasmic reticulum and recycling
        endosome membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        MAPKAPK2: This gene encodes a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
        This kinase is regulated through direct phosphorylation by p38 MAP kinase.
        In conjunction with p38 MAP kinase, this kinase is known to be involved in
        many cellular processes including stress and inflammatory responses, nuclear
        export, gene expression regulation and cell proliferation. Heat shock protein
        HSP27 was shown to be one of the substrates of this kinase in vivo. Two transcript
        variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        MAPKAPK3: This gene encodes a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
        This kinase functions as a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase)-
        activated protein kinase. MAP kinases are also known as extracellular signal-regulated
        kinases (ERKs), act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals.
        This kinase was shown to be activated by growth inducers and stress stimulation
        of cells. In vitro studies demonstrated that ERK, p38 MAP kinase and Jun N-terminal
        kinase were all able to phosphorylate and activate this kinase, which suggested
        the role of this kinase as an integrative element of signaling in both mitogen
        and stress responses. This kinase was reported to interact with, phosphorylate
        and repress the activity of E47, which is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription
        factor known to be involved in the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression
        and cell differentiation. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants that encode the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2011]


        PPT1: The protein encoded by this gene is a small glycoprotein involved in
        the catabolism of lipid-modified proteins during lysosomal degradation. The
        encoded enzyme removes thioester-linked fatty acyl groups such as palmitate
        from cysteine residues. Defects in this gene are a cause of infantile neuronal
        ceroid lipofuscinosis 1 (CLN1, or INCL) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis
        4 (CLN4). Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found
        for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2008]


        PYCARD: This gene encodes an adaptor protein that is composed of two protein-protein
        interaction domains: a N-terminal PYRIN-PAAD-DAPIN domain (PYD) and a C-terminal
        caspase-recruitment domain (CARD). The PYD and CARD domains are members of
        the six-helix bundle death domain-fold superfamily that mediates assembly
        of large signaling complexes in the inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathways
        via the activation of caspase. In normal cells, this protein is localized
        to the cytoplasm; however, in cells undergoing apoptosis, it forms ball-like
        aggregates near the nuclear periphery. Two transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        RAB34: This gene encodes a protein belonging to the RAB family of proteins,
        which are small GTPases involved in protein transport. This family member
        is a Golgi-bound member of the secretory pathway that is involved in the repositioning
        of lysosomes and the activation of macropinocytosis. Alternative splicing
        of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. An alternatively spliced
        transcript variant produces the nine-amino acid residue-repeats (NARR) protein,
        which is a functionally distinct nucleolar protein resulting from a different
        reading frame. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2016]


        SNX33: The protein encoded by this gene is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization,
        vesicle trafficking, endocytosis, and mitosis. The encoded protein is essential
        for the creation of the cleavage furrow during mitosis and for completion
        of mitosis. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been
        found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2015]


        SNX5: This gene encodes a member of the sorting nexin family. Members of this
        family contain a phox (PX) domain, which is a phosphoinositide binding domain,
        and are involved in intracellular trafficking. This protein functions in endosomal
        sorting, the phosphoinositide-signaling pathway, and macropinocytosis. This
        gene may play a role in the tumorigenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.
        Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]


        UBE3A: This gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, part of the ubiquitin
        protein degradation system. This imprinted gene is maternally expressed in
        brain and biallelically expressed in other tissues. Maternally inherited deletion
        of this gene causes Angelman Syndrome, characterized by severe motor and intellectual
        retardation, ataxia, hypotonia, epilepsy, absence of speech, and characteristic
        facies. The protein also interacts with the E6 protein of human papillomavirus
        types 16 and 18, resulting in ubiquitination and proteolysis of tumor protein
        p53. Alternative splicing of this gene results in three transcript variants
        encoding three isoforms with different N-termini. Additional transcript variants
        have been described, but their full length nature has not been determined.
        [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        LRP1: This gene encodes a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family
        of proteins. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed by furin
        to generate 515 kDa and 85 kDa subunits that form the mature receptor (PMID:
        8546712). This receptor is involved in several cellular processes, including
        intracellular signaling, lipid homeostasis, and clearance of apoptotic cells.
        In addition, the encoded protein is necessary for the alpha 2-macroglobulin-mediated
        clearance of secreted amyloid precursor protein and beta-amyloid, the main
        component of amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer patients. Expression of this
        gene decreases with age and has been found to be lower than controls in brain
        tissue from Alzheimer''s disease patients. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        CD36: The protein encoded by this gene is the fourth major glycoprotein of
        the platelet surface and serves as a receptor for thrombospondin in platelets
        and various cell lines. Since thrombospondins are widely distributed proteins
        involved in a variety of adhesive processes, this protein may have important
        functions as a cell adhesion molecule. It binds to collagen, thrombospondin,
        anionic phospholipids and oxidized LDL. It directly mediates cytoadherence
        of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized erythrocytes and it binds long chain
        fatty acids and may function in the transport and/or as a regulator of fatty
        acid transport. Mutations in this gene cause platelet glycoprotein deficiency.
        Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this
        gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        LDLR: The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family consists of
        cell surface proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific
        ligands. The encoded protein is normally bound at the cell membrane, where
        it binds low density lipoprotein/cholesterol and is taken into the cell. Lysosomes
        release the cholesterol, which is made available for repression of microsomal
        enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting
        step in cholesterol synthesis. At the same time, a reciprocal stimulation
        of cholesterol ester synthesis takes place. Mutations in this gene cause the
        autosomal dominant disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia. Alternate splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, May 2022]

        with microtubules. They have been implicated in cell processes such as endocytosis
        and cell motility, and in alterations of the membrane that accompany certain
        activities such as bone resorption by osteoclasts. Dynamins bind many proteins
        that bind actin and other cytoskeletal proteins. Dynamins can also self-assemble,
        a process that stimulates GTPase activity. Five alternatively spliced transcripts
        encoding different proteins have been described. Additional alternatively
        spliced transcripts may exist, but their full-length nature has not been determined.

        DOCK2: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the CDM protein family.
        It is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells and is predominantly expressed
        in peripheral blood leukocytes. The protein is involved in remodeling of the
        actin cytoskeleton required for lymphocyte migration in response to chemokine
        signaling. It activates members of the Rho family of GTPases, for example
        RAC1 and RAC2, by acting as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to
        exchange bound GDP for free GTP. Mutations in this gene result in immunodeficiency
        40 (IMD40), a combined form of immunodeficiency that affects T cell number
        and function, also with variable defects in B cell and NK cell function. [provided

        EHD4: Enables cadherin binding activity. Involved in endocytic recycling and
        protein homooligomerization. Located in endoplasmic reticulum and recycling
        endosome membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        MAPKAPK2: This gene encodes a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
        This kinase is regulated through direct phosphorylation by p38 MAP kinase.
        In conjunction with p38 MAP kinase, this kinase is known to be involved in
        many cellular processes including stress and inflammatory responses, nuclear
        export, gene expression regulation and cell proliferation. Heat shock protein
        HSP27 was shown to be one of the substrates of this kinase in vivo. Two transcript
        variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        MAPKAPK3: This gene encodes a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
        This kinase functions as a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase)-
        activated protein kinase. MAP kinases are also known as extracellular signal-regulated
        kinases (ERKs), act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals.
        This kinase was shown to be activated by growth inducers and stress stimulation
        of cells. In vitro studies demonstrated that ERK, p38 MAP kinase and Jun N-terminal
        kinase were all able to phosphorylate and activate this kinase, which suggested
        the role of this kinase as an integrative element of signaling in both mitogen
        and stress responses. This kinase was reported to interact with, phosphorylate
        and repress the activity of E47, which is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription
        factor known to be involved in the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression
        and cell differentiation. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants that encode the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2011]


        PPT1: The protein encoded by this gene is a small glycoprotein involved in
        the catabolism of lipid-modified proteins during lysosomal degradation. The
        encoded enzyme removes thioester-linked fatty acyl groups such as palmitate
        from cysteine residues. Defects in this gene are a cause of infantile neuronal
        ceroid lipofuscinosis 1 (CLN1, or INCL) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis
        4 (CLN4). Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found
        for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2008]


        PYCARD: This gene encodes an adaptor protein that is composed of two protein-protein
        interaction domains: a N-terminal PYRIN-PAAD-DAPIN domain (PYD) and a C-terminal
        caspase-recruitment domain (CARD). The PYD and CARD domains are members of
        the six-helix bundle death domain-fold superfamily that mediates assembly
        of large signaling complexes in the inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathways
        via the activation of caspase. In normal cells, this protein is localized
        to the cytoplasm; however, in cells undergoing apoptosis, it forms ball-like
        aggregates near the nuclear periphery. Two transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        RAB34: This gene encodes a protein belonging to the RAB family of proteins,
        which are small GTPases involved in protein transport. This family member
        is a Golgi-bound member of the secretory pathway that is involved in the repositioning
        of lysosomes and the activation of macropinocytosis. Alternative splicing
        of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. An alternatively spliced
        transcript variant produces the nine-amino acid residue-repeats (NARR) protein,
        which is a functionally distinct nucleolar protein resulting from a different
        reading frame. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2016]


        SNX33: The protein encoded by this gene is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization,
        vesicle trafficking, endocytosis, and mitosis. The encoded protein is essential
        for the creation of the cleavage furrow during mitosis and for completion
        of mitosis. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been
        found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2015]


        SNX5: This gene encodes a member of the sorting nexin family. Members of this
        family contain a phox (PX) domain, which is a phosphoinositide binding domain,
        and are involved in intracellular trafficking. This protein functions in endosomal
        sorting, the phosphoinositide-signaling pathway, and macropinocytosis. This
        gene may play a role in the tumorigenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.
        Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]


        UBE3A: This gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, part of the ubiquitin
        protein degradation system. This imprinted gene is maternally expressed in
        brain and biallelically expressed in other tissues. Maternally inherited deletion
        of this gene causes Angelman Syndrome, characterized by severe motor and intellectual
        retardation, ataxia, hypotonia, epilepsy, absence of speech, and characteristic
        facies. The protein also interacts with the E6 protein of human papillomavirus
        types 16 and 18, resulting in ubiquitination and proteolysis of tumor protein
        p53. Alternative splicing of this gene results in three transcript variants
        encoding three isoforms with different N-termini. Additional transcript variants
        have been described, but their full length nature has not been determined.

        LRP1: This gene encodes a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family
        of proteins. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed by furin
        to generate 515 kDa and 85 kDa subunits that form the mature receptor (PMID:
        8546712). This receptor is involved in several cellular processes, including
        intracellular signaling, lipid homeostasis, and clearance of apoptotic cells.
        In addition, the encoded protein is necessary for the alpha 2-macroglobulin-mediated
        clearance of secreted amyloid precursor protein and beta-amyloid, the main
        component of amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer patients. Expression of this
        gene decreases with age and has been found to be lower than controls in brain
        tissue from Alzheimer''s disease patients. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        CD36: The protein encoded by this gene is the fourth major glycoprotein of
        the platelet surface and serves as a receptor for thrombospondin in platelets
        and various cell lines. Since thrombospondins are widely distributed proteins
        involved in a variety of adhesive processes, this protein may have important
        functions as a cell adhesion molecule. It binds to collagen, thrombospondin,
        anionic phospholipids and oxidized LDL. It directly mediates cytoadherence
        of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized erythrocytes and it binds long chain
        fatty acids and may function in the transport and/or as a regulator of fatty
        acid transport. Mutations in this gene cause platelet glycoprotein deficiency.
        Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this
        gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        LDLR: The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family consists of
        cell surface proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific
        ligands. The encoded protein is normally bound at the cell membrane, where
        it binds low density lipoprotein/cholesterol and is taken into the cell. Lysosomes
        release the cholesterol, which is made available for repression of microsomal
        enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting
        step in cholesterol synthesis. At the same time, a reciprocal stimulation
        of cholesterol ester synthesis takes place. Mutations in this gene cause the
        autosomal dominant disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia. Alternate splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, May 2022]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        EHD4: Enables cadherin binding activity. Involved in endocytic recycling and
        protein homooligomerization. Located in endoplasmic reticulum and recycling
        endosome membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        AHSG: The protein encoded by this gene is a negatively-charged serum glycoprotein
        that is synthesized by hepatocytes. The encoded protein consists of two polypeptide
        chains, which are both cleaved from a proprotein encoded from a single mRNA.
        It is involved in several processes, including endocytosis, brain development,
        and the formation of bone tissue. Defects in this gene are a cause of susceptibility
        to leanness. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        LRP1: This gene encodes a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family
        of proteins. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed by furin
        to generate 515 kDa and 85 kDa subunits that form the mature receptor (PMID:
        8546712). This receptor is involved in several cellular processes, including
        intracellular signaling, lipid homeostasis, and clearance of apoptotic cells.
        In addition, the encoded protein is necessary for the alpha 2-macroglobulin-mediated
        clearance of secreted amyloid precursor protein and beta-amyloid, the main
        component of amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer patients. Expression of this
        gene decreases with age and has been found to be lower than controls in brain
        tissue from Alzheimer''s disease patients. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        LDLR: The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family consists of
        cell surface proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific
        ligands. The encoded protein is normally bound at the cell membrane, where
        it binds low density lipoprotein/cholesterol and is taken into the cell. Lysosomes
        release the cholesterol, which is made available for repression of microsomal
        enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting
        step in cholesterol synthesis. At the same time, a reciprocal stimulation
        of cholesterol ester synthesis takes place. Mutations in this gene cause the
        autosomal dominant disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia. Alternate splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, May 2022]


        DNM2: Dynamins represent one of the subfamilies of GTP-binding proteins. These
        proteins share considerable sequence similarity over the N-terminal portion
        of the molecule, which contains the GTPase domain. Dynamins are associated
        with microtubules. They have been implicated in cell processes such as endocytosis
        and cell motility, and in alterations of the membrane that accompany certain
        activities such as bone resorption by osteoclasts. Dynamins bind many proteins
        that bind actin and other cytoskeletal proteins. Dynamins can also self-assemble,
        a process that stimulates GTPase activity. Five alternatively spliced transcripts
        encoding different proteins have been described. Additional alternatively
        spliced transcripts may exist, but their full-length nature has not been determined.
        [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2010]


        SNX33: The protein encoded by this gene is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization,
        vesicle trafficking, endocytosis, and mitosis. The encoded protein is essential
        for the creation of the cleavage furrow during mitosis and for completion
        of mitosis. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been
        found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2015]


        CD36: The protein encoded by this gene is the fourth major glycoprotein of
        the platelet surface and serves as a receptor for thrombospondin in platelets
        and various cell lines. Since thrombospondins are widely distributed proteins
        involved in a variety of adhesive processes, this protein may have important
        functions as a cell adhesion molecule. It binds to collagen, thrombospondin,
        anionic phospholipids and oxidized LDL. It directly mediates cytoadherence
        of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized erythrocytes and it binds long chain
        fatty acids and may function in the transport and/or as a regulator of fatty
        acid transport. Mutations in this gene cause platelet glycoprotein deficiency.
        Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this
        gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        RAB34: This gene encodes a protein belonging to the RAB family of proteins,
        which are small GTPases involved in protein transport. This family member
        is a Golgi-bound member of the secretory pathway that is involved in the repositioning
        of lysosomes and the activation of macropinocytosis. Alternative splicing
        of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. An alternatively spliced
        transcript variant produces the nine-amino acid residue-repeats (NARR) protein,
        which is a functionally distinct nucleolar protein resulting from a different
        reading frame. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2016]


        UBE3A: This gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, part of the ubiquitin
        protein degradation system. This imprinted gene is maternally expressed in
        brain and biallelically expressed in other tissues. Maternally inherited deletion
        of this gene causes Angelman Syndrome, characterized by severe motor and intellectual
        retardation, ataxia, hypotonia, epilepsy, absence of speech, and characteristic
        facies. The protein also interacts with the E6 protein of human papillomavirus
        types 16 and 18, resulting in ubiquitination and proteolysis of tumor protein
        p53. Alternative splicing of this gene results in three transcript variants
        encoding three isoforms with different N-termini. Additional transcript variants
        have been described, but their full length nature has not been determined.
        [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PPT1: The protein encoded by this gene is a small glycoprotein involved in
        the catabolism of lipid-modified proteins during lysosomal degradation. The
        encoded enzyme removes thioester-linked fatty acyl groups such as palmitate
        from cysteine residues. Defects in this gene are a cause of infantile neuronal
        ceroid lipofuscinosis 1 (CLN1, or INCL) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis
        4 (CLN4). Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found
        for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2008]


        MAPKAPK3: This gene encodes a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
        This kinase functions as a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase)-
        activated protein kinase. MAP kinases are also known as extracellular signal-regulated
        kinases (ERKs), act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals.
        This kinase was shown to be activated by growth inducers and stress stimulation
        of cells. In vitro studies demonstrated that ERK, p38 MAP kinase and Jun N-terminal
        kinase were all able to phosphorylate and activate this kinase, which suggested
        the role of this kinase as an integrative element of signaling in both mitogen
        and stress responses. This kinase was reported to interact with, phosphorylate
        and repress the activity of E47, which is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription
        factor known to be involved in the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression
        and cell differentiation. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants that encode the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2011]


        DOCK2: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the CDM protein family.
        It is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells and is predominantly expressed
        in peripheral blood leukocytes. The protein is involved in remodeling of the
        actin cytoskeleton required for lymphocyte migration in response to chemokine
        signaling. It activates members of the Rho family of GTPases, for example
        RAC1 and RAC2, by acting as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to
        exchange bound GDP for free GTP. Mutations in this gene result in immunodeficiency
        40 (IMD40), a combined form of immunodeficiency that affects T cell number
        and function, also with variable defects in B cell and NK cell function. [provided
        by RefSeq, May 2018]


        SNX5: This gene encodes a member of the sorting nexin family. Members of this
        family contain a phox (PX) domain, which is a phosphoinositide binding domain,
        and are involved in intracellular trafficking. This protein functions in endosomal
        sorting, the phosphoinositide-signaling pathway, and macropinocytosis. This
        gene may play a role in the tumorigenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.
        Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]


        MAPKAPK2: This gene encodes a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
        This kinase is regulated through direct phosphorylation by p38 MAP kinase.
        In conjunction with p38 MAP kinase, this kinase is known to be involved in
        many cellular processes including stress and inflammatory responses, nuclear
        export, gene expression regulation and cell proliferation. Heat shock protein
        HSP27 was shown to be one of the substrates of this kinase in vivo. Two transcript
        variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PYCARD: This gene encodes an adaptor protein that is composed of two protein-protein
        interaction domains: a N-terminal PYRIN-PAAD-DAPIN domain (PYD) and a C-terminal
        caspase-recruitment domain (CARD). The PYD and CARD domains are members of
        the six-helix bundle death domain-fold superfamily that mediates assembly
        of large signaling complexes in the inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathways
        via the activation of caspase. In normal cells, this protein is localized
        to the cytoplasm; however, in cells undergoing apoptosis, it forms ball-like
        aggregates near the nuclear periphery. Two transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        and the formation of bone tissue. Defects in this gene are a cause of susceptibility
        to leanness. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        LRP1: This gene encodes a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family
        of proteins. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed by furin
        to generate 515 kDa and 85 kDa subunits that form the mature receptor (PMID:
        8546712). This receptor is involved in several cellular processes, including
        intracellular signaling, lipid homeostasis, and clearance of apoptotic cells.
        In addition, the encoded protein is necessary for the alpha 2-macroglobulin-mediated
        clearance of secreted amyloid precursor protein and beta-amyloid, the main
        component of amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer patients. Expression of this
        gene decreases with age and has been found to be lower than controls in brain
        tissue from Alzheimer''s disease patients. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        LDLR: The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family consists of
        cell surface proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific
        ligands. The encoded protein is normally bound at the cell membrane, where
        it binds low density lipoprotein/cholesterol and is taken into the cell. Lysosomes
        release the cholesterol, which is made available for repression of microsomal
        enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting
        step in cholesterol synthesis. At the same time, a reciprocal stimulation
        of cholesterol ester synthesis takes place. Mutations in this gene cause the
        autosomal dominant disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia. Alternate splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, May 2022]


        DNM2: Dynamins represent one of the subfamilies of GTP-binding proteins. These
        proteins share considerable sequence similarity over the N-terminal portion
        of the molecule, which contains the GTPase domain. Dynamins are associated
        with microtubules. They have been implicated in cell processes such as endocytosis
        and cell motility, and in alterations of the membrane that accompany certain
        activities such as bone resorption by osteoclasts. Dynamins bind many proteins
        that bind actin and other cytoskeletal proteins. Dynamins can also self-assemble,
        a process that stimulates GTPase activity. Five alternatively spliced transcripts
        encoding different proteins have been described. Additional alternatively
        spliced transcripts may exist, but their full-length nature has not been determined.

        SNX33: The protein encoded by this gene is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization,
        vesicle trafficking, endocytosis, and mitosis. The encoded protein is essential
        for the creation of the cleavage furrow during mitosis and for completion
        of mitosis. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been
        found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2015]


        CD36: The protein encoded by this gene is the fourth major glycoprotein of
        the platelet surface and serves as a receptor for thrombospondin in platelets
        and various cell lines. Since thrombospondins are widely distributed proteins
        involved in a variety of adhesive processes, this protein may have important
        functions as a cell adhesion molecule. It binds to collagen, thrombospondin,
        anionic phospholipids and oxidized LDL. It directly mediates cytoadherence
        of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized erythrocytes and it binds long chain
        fatty acids and may function in the transport and/or as a regulator of fatty
        acid transport. Mutations in this gene cause platelet glycoprotein deficiency.
        Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this
        gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        RAB34: This gene encodes a protein belonging to the RAB family of proteins,
        which are small GTPases involved in protein transport. This family member
        is a Golgi-bound member of the secretory pathway that is involved in the repositioning
        of lysosomes and the activation of macropinocytosis. Alternative splicing
        of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. An alternatively spliced
        transcript variant produces the nine-amino acid residue-repeats (NARR) protein,
        which is a functionally distinct nucleolar protein resulting from a different
        reading frame. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2016]


        UBE3A: This gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, part of the ubiquitin
        protein degradation system. This imprinted gene is maternally expressed in
        brain and biallelically expressed in other tissues. Maternally inherited deletion
        of this gene causes Angelman Syndrome, characterized by severe motor and intellectual
        retardation, ataxia, hypotonia, epilepsy, absence of speech, and characteristic
        facies. The protein also interacts with the E6 protein of human papillomavirus
        types 16 and 18, resulting in ubiquitination and proteolysis of tumor protein
        p53. Alternative splicing of this gene results in three transcript variants
        encoding three isoforms with different N-termini. Additional transcript variants
        have been described, but their full length nature has not been determined.

        PPT1: The protein encoded by this gene is a small glycoprotein involved in
        the catabolism of lipid-modified proteins during lysosomal degradation. The
        encoded enzyme removes thioester-linked fatty acyl groups such as palmitate
        from cysteine residues. Defects in this gene are a cause of infantile neuronal
        ceroid lipofuscinosis 1 (CLN1, or INCL) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis
        4 (CLN4). Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found
        for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2008]


        MAPKAPK3: This gene encodes a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
        This kinase functions as a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase)-
        activated protein kinase. MAP kinases are also known as extracellular signal-regulated
        kinases (ERKs), act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals.
        This kinase was shown to be activated by growth inducers and stress stimulation
        of cells. In vitro studies demonstrated that ERK, p38 MAP kinase and Jun N-terminal
        kinase were all able to phosphorylate and activate this kinase, which suggested
        the role of this kinase as an integrative element of signaling in both mitogen
        and stress responses. This kinase was reported to interact with, phosphorylate
        and repress the activity of E47, which is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription
        factor known to be involved in the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression
        and cell differentiation. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants that encode the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2011]


        DOCK2: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the CDM protein family.
        It is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells and is predominantly expressed
        in peripheral blood leukocytes. The protein is involved in remodeling of the
        actin cytoskeleton required for lymphocyte migration in response to chemokine
        signaling. It activates members of the Rho family of GTPases, for example
        RAC1 and RAC2, by acting as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to
        exchange bound GDP for free GTP. Mutations in this gene result in immunodeficiency
        40 (IMD40), a combined form of immunodeficiency that affects T cell number
        and function, also with variable defects in B cell and NK cell function. [provided
        by RefSeq, May 2018]


        SNX5: This gene encodes a member of the sorting nexin family. Members of this
        family contain a phox (PX) domain, which is a phosphoinositide binding domain,
        and are involved in intracellular trafficking. This protein functions in endosomal
        sorting, the phosphoinositide-signaling pathway, and macropinocytosis. This
        gene may play a role in the tumorigenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.
        Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]


        MAPKAPK2: This gene encodes a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
        This kinase is regulated through direct phosphorylation by p38 MAP kinase.
        In conjunction with p38 MAP kinase, this kinase is known to be involved in
        many cellular processes including stress and inflammatory responses, nuclear
        export, gene expression regulation and cell proliferation. Heat shock protein
        HSP27 was shown to be one of the substrates of this kinase in vivo. Two transcript
        variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PYCARD: This gene encodes an adaptor protein that is composed of two protein-protein
        interaction domains: a N-terminal PYRIN-PAAD-DAPIN domain (PYD) and a C-terminal
        caspase-recruitment domain (CARD). The PYD and CARD domains are members of
        the six-helix bundle death domain-fold superfamily that mediates assembly
        of large signaling complexes in the inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathways
        via the activation of caspase. In normal cells, this protein is localized
        to the cytoplasm; however, in cells undergoing apoptosis, it forms ball-like
        aggregates near the nuclear periphery. Two transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        EHD4: Enables cadherin binding activity. Involved in endocytic recycling and
        protein homooligomerization. Located in endoplasmic reticulum and recycling
        endosome membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        AHSG: The protein encoded by this gene is a negatively-charged serum glycoprotein
        that is synthesized by hepatocytes. The encoded protein consists of two polypeptide
        chains, which are both cleaved from a proprotein encoded from a single mRNA.
        It is involved in several processes, including endocytosis, brain development,
        and the formation of bone tissue. Defects in this gene are a cause of susceptibility
        to leanness. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        LRP1: This gene encodes a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family
        of proteins. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed by furin
        to generate 515 kDa and 85 kDa subunits that form the mature receptor (PMID:
        8546712). This receptor is involved in several cellular processes, including
        intracellular signaling, lipid homeostasis, and clearance of apoptotic cells.
        In addition, the encoded protein is necessary for the alpha 2-macroglobulin-mediated
        clearance of secreted amyloid precursor protein and beta-amyloid, the main
        component of amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer patients. Expression of this
        gene decreases with age and has been found to be lower than controls in brain
        tissue from Alzheimer''s disease patients. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        LDLR: The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family consists of
        cell surface proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific
        ligands. The encoded protein is normally bound at the cell membrane, where
        it binds low density lipoprotein/cholesterol and is taken into the cell. Lysosomes
        release the cholesterol, which is made available for repression of microsomal
        enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting
        step in cholesterol synthesis. At the same time, a reciprocal stimulation
        of cholesterol ester synthesis takes place. Mutations in this gene cause the
        autosomal dominant disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia. Alternate splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, May 2022]


        DNM2: Dynamins represent one of the subfamilies of GTP-binding proteins. These
        proteins share considerable sequence similarity over the N-terminal portion
        of the molecule, which contains the GTPase domain. Dynamins are associated
        with microtubules. They have been implicated in cell processes such as endocytosis
        and cell motility, and in alterations of the membrane that accompany certain
        activities such as bone resorption by osteoclasts. Dynamins bind many proteins
        that bind actin and other cytoskeletal proteins. Dynamins can also self-assemble,
        a process that stimulates GTPase activity. Five alternatively spliced transcripts
        encoding different proteins have been described. Additional alternatively
        spliced transcripts may exist, but their full-length nature has not been determined.
        [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2010]


        SNX33: The protein encoded by this gene is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization,
        vesicle trafficking, endocytosis, and mitosis. The encoded protein is essential
        for the creation of the cleavage furrow during mitosis and for completion
        of mitosis. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been
        found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2015]


        CD36: The protein encoded by this gene is the fourth major glycoprotein of
        the platelet surface and serves as a receptor for thrombospondin in platelets
        and various cell lines. Since thrombospondins are widely distributed proteins
        involved in a variety of adhesive processes, this protein may have important
        functions as a cell adhesion molecule. It binds to collagen, thrombospondin,
        anionic phospholipids and oxidized LDL. It directly mediates cytoadherence
        of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized erythrocytes and it binds long chain
        fatty acids and may function in the transport and/or as a regulator of fatty
        acid transport. Mutations in this gene cause platelet glycoprotein deficiency.
        Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this
        gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        RAB34: This gene encodes a protein belonging to the RAB family of proteins,
        which are small GTPases involved in protein transport. This family member
        is a Golgi-bound member of the secretory pathway that is involved in the repositioning
        of lysosomes and the activation of macropinocytosis. Alternative splicing
        of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. An alternatively spliced
        transcript variant produces the nine-amino acid residue-repeats (NARR) protein,
        which is a functionally distinct nucleolar protein resulting from a different
        reading frame. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2016]


        UBE3A: This gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, part of the ubiquitin
        protein degradation system. This imprinted gene is maternally expressed in
        brain and biallelically expressed in other tissues. Maternally inherited deletion
        of this gene causes Angelman Syndrome, characterized by severe motor and intellectual
        retardation, ataxia, hypotonia, epilepsy, absence of speech, and characteristic
        facies. The protein also interacts with the E6 protein of human papillomavirus
        types 16 and 18, resulting in ubiquitination and proteolysis of tumor protein
        p53. Alternative splicing of this gene results in three transcript variants
        encoding three isoforms with different N-termini. Additional transcript variants
        have been described, but their full length nature has not been determined.
        [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PPT1: The protein encoded by this gene is a small glycoprotein involved in
        the catabolism of lipid-modified proteins during lysosomal degradation. The
        encoded enzyme removes thioester-linked fatty acyl groups such as palmitate
        from cysteine residues. Defects in this gene are a cause of infantile neuronal
        ceroid lipofuscinosis 1 (CLN1, or INCL) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis
        4 (CLN4). Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found
        for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2008]


        MAPKAPK3: This gene encodes a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
        This kinase functions as a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase)-
        activated protein kinase. MAP kinases are also known as extracellular signal-regulated
        kinases (ERKs), act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals.
        This kinase was shown to be activated by growth inducers and stress stimulation
        of cells. In vitro studies demonstrated that ERK, p38 MAP kinase and Jun N-terminal
        kinase were all able to phosphorylate and activate this kinase, which suggested
        the role of this kinase as an integrative element of signaling in both mitogen
        and stress responses. This kinase was reported to interact with, phosphorylate
        and repress the activity of E47, which is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription
        factor known to be involved in the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression
        and cell differentiation. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants that encode the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2011]


        DOCK2: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the CDM protein family.
        It is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells and is predominantly expressed
        in peripheral blood leukocytes. The protein is involved in remodeling of the
        actin cytoskeleton required for lymphocyte migration in response to chemokine
        signaling. It activates members of the Rho family of GTPases, for example
        RAC1 and RAC2, by acting as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to
        exchange bound GDP for free GTP. Mutations in this gene result in immunodeficiency
        40 (IMD40), a combined form of immunodeficiency that affects T cell number
        and function, also with variable defects in B cell and NK cell function. [provided
        by RefSeq, May 2018]


        SNX5: This gene encodes a member of the sorting nexin family. Members of this
        family contain a phox (PX) domain, which is a phosphoinositide binding domain,
        and are involved in intracellular trafficking. This protein functions in endosomal
        sorting, the phosphoinositide-signaling pathway, and macropinocytosis. This
        gene may play a role in the tumorigenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.
        Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]


        MAPKAPK2: This gene encodes a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
        This kinase is regulated through direct phosphorylation by p38 MAP kinase.
        In conjunction with p38 MAP kinase, this kinase is known to be involved in
        many cellular processes including stress and inflammatory responses, nuclear
        export, gene expression regulation and cell proliferation. Heat shock protein
        HSP27 was shown to be one of the substrates of this kinase in vivo. Two transcript
        variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PYCARD: This gene encodes an adaptor protein that is composed of two protein-protein
        interaction domains: a N-terminal PYRIN-PAAD-DAPIN domain (PYD) and a C-terminal
        caspase-recruitment domain (CARD). The PYD and CARD domains are members of
        the six-helix bundle death domain-fold superfamily that mediates assembly
        of large signaling complexes in the inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathways
        via the activation of caspase. In normal cells, this protein is localized
        to the cytoplasm; however, in cells undergoing apoptosis, it forms ball-like
        aggregates near the nuclear periphery. Two transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.


        Provide results in the format


        Summary: <high level summary>

        Mechanism: <mechanism>

        Enriched Terms: <term1>; <term2>; <term3>


        For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number
        the list.

        Always put the list of terms last, after mechanism, summary, or hypotheses.



        Here are the gene summaries:



        EHD4: Enables cadherin binding activity. Involved in endocytic recycling and
        protein homooligomerization. Located in endoplasmic reticulum and recycling
        endosome membrane. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        AHSG: The protein encoded by this gene is a negatively-charged serum glycoprotein
        that is synthesized by hepatocytes. The encoded protein consists of two polypeptide
        chains, which are both cleaved from a proprotein encoded from a single mRNA.
        It is involved in several processes, including endocytosis, brain development,
        and the formation of bone tissue. Defects in this gene are a cause of susceptibility
        to leanness. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        LRP1: This gene encodes a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family
        of proteins. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed by furin
        to generate 515 kDa and 85 kDa subunits that form the mature receptor (PMID:
        8546712). This receptor is involved in several cellular processes, including
        intracellular signaling, lipid homeostasis, and clearance of apoptotic cells.
        In addition, the encoded protein is necessary for the alpha 2-macroglobulin-mediated
        clearance of secreted amyloid precursor protein and beta-amyloid, the main
        component of amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer patients. Expression of this
        gene decreases with age and has been found to be lower than controls in brain
        tissue from Alzheimer''s disease patients. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        LDLR: The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family consists of
        cell surface proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific
        ligands. The encoded protein is normally bound at the cell membrane, where
        it binds low density lipoprotein/cholesterol and is taken into the cell. Lysosomes
        release the cholesterol, which is made available for repression of microsomal
        enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting
        step in cholesterol synthesis. At the same time, a reciprocal stimulation
        of cholesterol ester synthesis takes place. Mutations in this gene cause the
        autosomal dominant disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia. Alternate splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, May 2022]


        DNM2: Dynamins represent one of the subfamilies of GTP-binding proteins. These
        proteins share considerable sequence similarity over the N-terminal portion
        of the molecule, which contains the GTPase domain. Dynamins are associated
        with microtubules. They have been implicated in cell processes such as endocytosis
        and cell motility, and in alterations of the membrane that accompany certain
        activities such as bone resorption by osteoclasts. Dynamins bind many proteins
        that bind actin and other cytoskeletal proteins. Dynamins can also self-assemble,
        a process that stimulates GTPase activity. Five alternatively spliced transcripts
        encoding different proteins have been described. Additional alternatively
        spliced transcripts may exist, but their full-length nature has not been determined.
        [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2010]


        SNX33: The protein encoded by this gene is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization,
        vesicle trafficking, endocytosis, and mitosis. The encoded protein is essential
        for the creation of the cleavage furrow during mitosis and for completion
        of mitosis. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been
        found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2015]


        CD36: The protein encoded by this gene is the fourth major glycoprotein of
        the platelet surface and serves as a receptor for thrombospondin in platelets
        and various cell lines. Since thrombospondins are widely distributed proteins
        involved in a variety of adhesive processes, this protein may have important
        functions as a cell adhesion molecule. It binds to collagen, thrombospondin,
        anionic phospholipids and oxidized LDL. It directly mediates cytoadherence
        of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized erythrocytes and it binds long chain
        fatty acids and may function in the transport and/or as a regulator of fatty
        acid transport. Mutations in this gene cause platelet glycoprotein deficiency.
        Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this
        gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]


        RAB34: This gene encodes a protein belonging to the RAB family of proteins,
        which are small GTPases involved in protein transport. This family member
        is a Golgi-bound member of the secretory pathway that is involved in the repositioning
        of lysosomes and the activation of macropinocytosis. Alternative splicing
        of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. An alternatively spliced
        transcript variant produces the nine-amino acid residue-repeats (NARR) protein,
        which is a functionally distinct nucleolar protein resulting from a different
        reading frame. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2016]


        UBE3A: This gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, part of the ubiquitin
        protein degradation system. This imprinted gene is maternally expressed in
        brain and biallelically expressed in other tissues. Maternally inherited deletion
        of this gene causes Angelman Syndrome, characterized by severe motor and intellectual
        retardation, ataxia, hypotonia, epilepsy, absence of speech, and characteristic
        facies. The protein also interacts with the E6 protein of human papillomavirus
        types 16 and 18, resulting in ubiquitination and proteolysis of tumor protein
        p53. Alternative splicing of this gene results in three transcript variants
        encoding three isoforms with different N-termini. Additional transcript variants
        have been described, but their full length nature has not been determined.
        [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PPT1: The protein encoded by this gene is a small glycoprotein involved in
        the catabolism of lipid-modified proteins during lysosomal degradation. The
        encoded enzyme removes thioester-linked fatty acyl groups such as palmitate
        from cysteine residues. Defects in this gene are a cause of infantile neuronal
        ceroid lipofuscinosis 1 (CLN1, or INCL) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis
        4 (CLN4). Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found
        for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2008]


        MAPKAPK3: This gene encodes a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
        This kinase functions as a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase)-
        activated protein kinase. MAP kinases are also known as extracellular signal-regulated
        kinases (ERKs), act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals.
        This kinase was shown to be activated by growth inducers and stress stimulation
        of cells. In vitro studies demonstrated that ERK, p38 MAP kinase and Jun N-terminal
        kinase were all able to phosphorylate and activate this kinase, which suggested
        the role of this kinase as an integrative element of signaling in both mitogen
        and stress responses. This kinase was reported to interact with, phosphorylate
        and repress the activity of E47, which is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription
        factor known to be involved in the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression
        and cell differentiation. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants that encode the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2011]


        DOCK2: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the CDM protein family.
        It is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells and is predominantly expressed
        in peripheral blood leukocytes. The protein is involved in remodeling of the
        actin cytoskeleton required for lymphocyte migration in response to chemokine
        signaling. It activates members of the Rho family of GTPases, for example
        RAC1 and RAC2, by acting as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to
        exchange bound GDP for free GTP. Mutations in this gene result in immunodeficiency
        40 (IMD40), a combined form of immunodeficiency that affects T cell number
        and function, also with variable defects in B cell and NK cell function. [provided
        by RefSeq, May 2018]


        SNX5: This gene encodes a member of the sorting nexin family. Members of this
        family contain a phox (PX) domain, which is a phosphoinositide binding domain,
        and are involved in intracellular trafficking. This protein functions in endosomal
        sorting, the phosphoinositide-signaling pathway, and macropinocytosis. This
        gene may play a role in the tumorigenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.
        Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]


        MAPKAPK2: This gene encodes a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
        This kinase is regulated through direct phosphorylation by p38 MAP kinase.
        In conjunction with p38 MAP kinase, this kinase is known to be involved in
        many cellular processes including stress and inflammatory responses, nuclear
        export, gene expression regulation and cell proliferation. Heat shock protein
        HSP27 was shown to be one of the substrates of this kinase in vivo. Two transcript
        variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        PYCARD: This gene encodes an adaptor protein that is composed of two protein-protein
        interaction domains: a N-terminal PYRIN-PAAD-DAPIN domain (PYD) and a C-terminal
        caspase-recruitment domain (CARD). The PYD and CARD domains are members of
        the six-helix bundle death domain-fold superfamily that mediates assembly
        of large signaling complexes in the inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathways
        via the activation of caspase. In normal cells, this protein is localized
        to the cytoplasm; however, in cells undergoing apoptosis, it forms ball-like
        aggregates near the nuclear periphery. Two transcript variants encoding different
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
