        Here are the gene summaries:



        TNXB: This gene encodes a member of the tenascin family of extracellular matrix
        glycoproteins. The tenascins have anti-adhesive effects, as opposed to fibronectin
        which is adhesive. This protein is thought to function in matrix maturation
        during wound healing, and its deficiency has been associated with the connective
        tissue disorder Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This gene localizes to the major histocompatibility
        complex (MHC) class III region on chromosome 6. It is one of four genes in
        this cluster which have been duplicated. The duplicated copy of this gene
        is incomplete and is a pseudogene which is transcribed but does not encode
        a protein. The structure of this gene is unusual in that it overlaps the CREBL1
        and CYP21A2 genes at its 5'' and 3'' ends, respectively. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        C1R: This gene encodes a member of the peptidase S1 protein family. The encoded
        protein is a proteolytic subunit in the complement system C1 complex. The
        complement system acts as a mediator in the innate immune response by ultimately
        triggering phagocytosis, inflammation, and rupturing the bacterial cell wall.
        Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. [provided
        by RefSeq, Dec 2018]


        C1S: This gene encodes a serine protease, which is a major constituent of
        the human complement subcomponent C1. C1s associates with two other complement
        components C1r and C1q in order to yield the first component of the serum
        complement system. Defects in this gene are the cause of selective C1s deficiency.
        [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2009]


        B3GALT6: The enzyme encoded by this intronless gene is a beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase
        found in the medial Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the transfer of galactose
        from UDP-galactose to substrates containing a terminal beta-linked galactose
        moiety. The encoded enzyme has a particular affinity for galactose-beta-1,4-xylose
        found in the linker region of glycosamines. This enzyme is required for glycosaminoglycan
        synthesis. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2013]


        FKBP14: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the FK506-binding
        protein family of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases. The encoded protein
        is found in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is thought to
        accelerate protein folding. Defects in this gene are a cause of a type of
        Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Both a protein-coding variant and noncoding
        variants are transcribed from this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012]


        SLC39A13: This gene encodes a member of the LIV-1 subfamily of the ZIP transporter
        family. The encoded transmembrane protein functions as a zinc transporter.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with the spondylocheiro dysplastic
        form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Alternate transcript variants have been found
        for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2016]


        DSE: The protein encoded by this gene is a tumor-rejection antigen. It is
        localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and functions to convert D-glucuronic
        acid to L-iduronic acid during the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate. This
        antigen possesses tumor epitopes capable of inducing HLA-A24-restricted and
        tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in cancer patients and may be useful
        for specific immunotherapy. Mutations in this gene cause inmusculocontractural
        Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. A related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 9, and a
        paralogous gene exists on chromosome 18. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2016]


        COL12A1: This gene encodes the alpha chain of type XII collagen, a member
        of the FACIT (fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices)
        collagen family. Type XII collagen is a homotrimer found in association with
        type I collagen, an association that is thought to modify the interactions
        between collagen I fibrils and the surrounding matrix. Alternatively spliced
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ADAMTS2: This gene encodes a member of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase
        with thrombospondin motifs) protein family. Members of the family share several
        distinct protein modules, including a propeptide region, a metalloproteinase
        domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and a thrombospondin type 1 (TS) motif.
        Individual members of this family differ in the number of C-terminal TS motifs,
        and some have unique C-terminal domains. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically
        processed to generate the mature procollagen N-proteinase. This proteinase
        excises the N-propeptide of the fibrillar procollagens types I-III and type
        V. Mutations in this gene cause Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC, a recessively
        inherited connective-tissue disorder. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically
        processed. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        COL1A2: This gene encodes the pro-alpha2 chain of type I collagen whose triple
        helix comprises two alpha1 chains and one alpha2 chain. Type I is a fibril-forming
        collagen found in most connective tissues and is abundant in bone, cornea,
        dermis and tendon. Mutations in this gene are associated with osteogenesis
        imperfecta types I-IV, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIB, recessive Ehlers-Danlos
        syndrome Classical type, idiopathic osteoporosis, and atypical Marfan syndrome.
        Symptoms associated with mutations in this gene, however, tend to be less
        severe than mutations in the gene for the alpha1 chain of type I collagen
        (COL1A1) reflecting the different role of alpha2 chains in matrix integrity.
        Three transcripts, resulting from the use of alternate polyadenylation signals,
        have been identified for this gene. [provided by R. Dalgleish, Feb 2008]


        COL3A1: This gene encodes the pro-alpha1 chains of type III collagen, a fibrillar
        collagen that is found in extensible connective tissues such as skin, lung,
        uterus, intestine and the vascular system, frequently in association with
        type I collagen. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos
        syndrome type IV, and with aortic and arterial aneurysms. [provided by R.
        Dalgleish, Feb 2008]


        COL5A1: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar
        collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of
        one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing
        type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers
        composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely
        related to type XI collagen and it is possible that the collagen chains of
        types V and XI constitute a single collagen type with tissue-specific chain
        combinations. The encoded procollagen protein occurs commonly as the heterotrimer
        pro-alpha1(V)-pro-alpha1(V)-pro-alpha2(V). Mutations in this gene are associated
        with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, types I and II. Alternative splicing of this
        gene results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2013]


        COL5A2: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar
        collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of

        combinations. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
        types I and II. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ZNF469: This gene encodes a zinc-finger protein. Low-percent homology to certain
        collagens suggests that it may function as a transcription factor or extra-nuclear
        regulator factor for the synthesis or organization of collagen fibers. Mutations
        in this gene cause brittle cornea syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        CHST14: This gene encodes a member of the HNK-1 family of sulfotransferases.
        The encoded protein transfers sulfate to the C-4 hydroxyl of N-acetylgalactosamine
        residues in dermatan sulfate. Mutations in this gene have been associated
        with adducted thumb-clubfoot syndrome.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2010]


        AEBP1: This gene encodes a member of carboxypeptidase A protein family. The
        encoded protein may function as a transcriptional repressor and play a role
        in adipogenesis and smooth muscle cell differentiation. Studies in mice suggest
        that this gene functions in wound healing and abdominal wall development.
        Overexpression of this gene is associated with glioblastoma. [provided by
        RefSeq, May 2013]


        PLOD1: Lysyl hydroxylase is a membrane-bound homodimeric protein localized
        to the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum. The enzyme (cofactors iron
        and ascorbate) catalyzes the hydroxylation of lysyl residues in collagen-like
        peptides. The resultant hydroxylysyl groups are attachment sites for carbohydrates
        in collagen and thus are critical for the stability of intermolecular crosslinks.
        Some patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VI have deficiencies in lysyl
        hydroxylase activity. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms
        have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        B4GALT7: This gene is a member of the beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT)
        family. Family members encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear
        to have exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose. Each
        beta4GalT member has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different
        glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they
        have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to
        the Golgi apparatus which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane
        anchor. The enzyme encoded by this gene attaches the first galactose in the
        common carbohydrate-protein linkage (GlcA-beta1,3-Gal-beta1,3-Gal-beta1,4-Xyl-beta1-O-Ser)
        found in proteoglycans. This enzyme differs from other beta4GalTs because
        it lacks the conserved Cys residues found in beta4GalT1-beta4GalT6 and it
        is located in cis-Golgi instead of trans-Golgi. Mutations in this gene have
        been associated with the progeroid form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. [provided
        by RefSeq, Oct 2009]


        PRDM5: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcription factor of the PR-domain
        protein family. It contains a PR-domain and multiple zinc finger motifs. Transcription
        factors of the PR-domain family are known to be involved in cell differentiation
        and tumorigenesis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        ADAMTS2: This gene encodes a member of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase
        with thrombospondin motifs) protein family. Members of the family share several
        distinct protein modules, including a propeptide region, a metalloproteinase
        domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and a thrombospondin type 1 (TS) motif.
        Individual members of this family differ in the number of C-terminal TS motifs,
        and some have unique C-terminal domains. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically
        processed to generate the mature procollagen N-proteinase. This proteinase
        excises the N-propeptide of the fibrillar procollagens types I-III and type
        V. Mutations in this gene cause Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC, a recessively
        inherited connective-tissue disorder. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically
        processed. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        COL1A2: This gene encodes the pro-alpha2 chain of type I collagen whose triple
        helix comprises two alpha1 chains and one alpha2 chain. Type I is a fibril-forming
        collagen found in most connective tissues and is abundant in bone, cornea,
        dermis and tendon. Mutations in this gene are associated with osteogenesis
        imperfecta types I-IV, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIB, recessive Ehlers-Danlos
        syndrome Classical type, idiopathic osteoporosis, and atypical Marfan syndrome.
        Symptoms associated with mutations in this gene, however, tend to be less
        severe than mutations in the gene for the alpha1 chain of type I collagen
        (COL1A1) reflecting the different role of alpha2 chains in matrix integrity.
        Three transcripts, resulting from the use of alternate polyadenylation signals,
        have been identified for this gene. [provided by R. Dalgleish, Feb 2008]


        COL3A1: This gene encodes the pro-alpha1 chains of type III collagen, a fibrillar
        collagen that is found in extensible connective tissues such as skin, lung,
        uterus, intestine and the vascular system, frequently in association with
        type I collagen. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos
        syndrome type IV, and with aortic and arterial aneurysms. [provided by R.
        Dalgleish, Feb 2008]


        COL5A1: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar
        collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of
        one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing
        type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers
        composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely
        related to type XI collagen and it is possible that the collagen chains of
        types V and XI constitute a single collagen type with tissue-specific chain
        combinations. The encoded procollagen protein occurs commonly as the heterotrimer
        pro-alpha1(V)-pro-alpha1(V)-pro-alpha2(V). Mutations in this gene are associated
        with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, types I and II. Alternative splicing of this
        gene results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2013]


        COL5A2: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar
        collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of
        one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing
        type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers
        composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely

        types V and XI constitute a single collagen type with tissue-specific chain
        combinations. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
        types I and II. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ZNF469: This gene encodes a zinc-finger protein. Low-percent homology to certain
        collagens suggests that it may function as a transcription factor or extra-nuclear
        regulator factor for the synthesis or organization of collagen fibers. Mutations
        in this gene cause brittle cornea syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        CHST14: This gene encodes a member of the HNK-1 family of sulfotransferases.
        The encoded protein transfers sulfate to the C-4 hydroxyl of N-acetylgalactosamine
        residues in dermatan sulfate. Mutations in this gene have been associated
        with adducted thumb-clubfoot syndrome.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2010]


        AEBP1: This gene encodes a member of carboxypeptidase A protein family. The
        encoded protein may function as a transcriptional repressor and play a role
        in adipogenesis and smooth muscle cell differentiation. Studies in mice suggest
        that this gene functions in wound healing and abdominal wall development.
        Overexpression of this gene is associated with glioblastoma. [provided by
        RefSeq, May 2013]


        PLOD1: Lysyl hydroxylase is a membrane-bound homodimeric protein localized
        to the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum. The enzyme (cofactors iron
        and ascorbate) catalyzes the hydroxylation of lysyl residues in collagen-like
        peptides. The resultant hydroxylysyl groups are attachment sites for carbohydrates
        in collagen and thus are critical for the stability of intermolecular crosslinks.
        Some patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VI have deficiencies in lysyl
        hydroxylase activity. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms
        have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        B4GALT7: This gene is a member of the beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT)
        family. Family members encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear
        to have exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose. Each
        beta4GalT member has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different
        glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they
        have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to
        the Golgi apparatus which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane
        anchor. The enzyme encoded by this gene attaches the first galactose in the
        common carbohydrate-protein linkage (GlcA-beta1,3-Gal-beta1,3-Gal-beta1,4-Xyl-beta1-O-Ser)
        found in proteoglycans. This enzyme differs from other beta4GalTs because
        it lacks the conserved Cys residues found in beta4GalT1-beta4GalT6 and it
        is located in cis-Golgi instead of trans-Golgi. Mutations in this gene have
        been associated with the progeroid form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. [provided
        by RefSeq, Oct 2009]


        PRDM5: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcription factor of the PR-domain
        protein family. It contains a PR-domain and multiple zinc finger motifs. Transcription
        factors of the PR-domain family are known to be involved in cell differentiation
        and tumorigenesis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        TNXB: This gene encodes a member of the tenascin family of extracellular matrix
        glycoproteins. The tenascins have anti-adhesive effects, as opposed to fibronectin
        which is adhesive. This protein is thought to function in matrix maturation
        during wound healing, and its deficiency has been associated with the connective
        tissue disorder Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This gene localizes to the major histocompatibility
        complex (MHC) class III region on chromosome 6. It is one of four genes in
        this cluster which have been duplicated. The duplicated copy of this gene
        is incomplete and is a pseudogene which is transcribed but does not encode
        a protein. The structure of this gene is unusual in that it overlaps the CREBL1
        and CYP21A2 genes at its 5'' and 3'' ends, respectively. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        C1R: This gene encodes a member of the peptidase S1 protein family. The encoded
        protein is a proteolytic subunit in the complement system C1 complex. The
        complement system acts as a mediator in the innate immune response by ultimately
        triggering phagocytosis, inflammation, and rupturing the bacterial cell wall.
        Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. [provided
        by RefSeq, Dec 2018]


        C1S: This gene encodes a serine protease, which is a major constituent of
        the human complement subcomponent C1. C1s associates with two other complement
        components C1r and C1q in order to yield the first component of the serum
        complement system. Defects in this gene are the cause of selective C1s deficiency.
        [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2009]


        B3GALT6: The enzyme encoded by this intronless gene is a beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase
        found in the medial Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the transfer of galactose
        from UDP-galactose to substrates containing a terminal beta-linked galactose
        moiety. The encoded enzyme has a particular affinity for galactose-beta-1,4-xylose
        found in the linker region of glycosamines. This enzyme is required for glycosaminoglycan
        synthesis. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2013]


        FKBP14: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the FK506-binding
        protein family of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases. The encoded protein
        is found in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is thought to
        accelerate protein folding. Defects in this gene are a cause of a type of
        Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Both a protein-coding variant and noncoding
        variants are transcribed from this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012]


        SLC39A13: This gene encodes a member of the LIV-1 subfamily of the ZIP transporter
        family. The encoded transmembrane protein functions as a zinc transporter.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with the spondylocheiro dysplastic
        form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Alternate transcript variants have been found
        for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2016]


        DSE: The protein encoded by this gene is a tumor-rejection antigen. It is
        localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and functions to convert D-glucuronic
        acid to L-iduronic acid during the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate. This
        antigen possesses tumor epitopes capable of inducing HLA-A24-restricted and
        tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in cancer patients and may be useful
        for specific immunotherapy. Mutations in this gene cause inmusculocontractural
        Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. A related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 9, and a
        paralogous gene exists on chromosome 18. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2016]


        COL12A1: This gene encodes the alpha chain of type XII collagen, a member
        of the FACIT (fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices)
        collagen family. Type XII collagen is a homotrimer found in association with
        type I collagen, an association that is thought to modify the interactions
        between collagen I fibrils and the surrounding matrix. Alternatively spliced
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ADAMTS2: This gene encodes a member of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase
        with thrombospondin motifs) protein family. Members of the family share several
        distinct protein modules, including a propeptide region, a metalloproteinase
        domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and a thrombospondin type 1 (TS) motif.
        Individual members of this family differ in the number of C-terminal TS motifs,
        and some have unique C-terminal domains. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically
        processed to generate the mature procollagen N-proteinase. This proteinase
        excises the N-propeptide of the fibrillar procollagens types I-III and type
        V. Mutations in this gene cause Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC, a recessively
        inherited connective-tissue disorder. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically
        processed. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        COL1A2: This gene encodes the pro-alpha2 chain of type I collagen whose triple
        helix comprises two alpha1 chains and one alpha2 chain. Type I is a fibril-forming
        collagen found in most connective tissues and is abundant in bone, cornea,
        dermis and tendon. Mutations in this gene are associated with osteogenesis
        imperfecta types I-IV, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIB, recessive Ehlers-Danlos
        syndrome Classical type, idiopathic osteoporosis, and atypical Marfan syndrome.
        Symptoms associated with mutations in this gene, however, tend to be less
        severe than mutations in the gene for the alpha1 chain of type I collagen
        (COL1A1) reflecting the different role of alpha2 chains in matrix integrity.
        Three transcripts, resulting from the use of alternate polyadenylation signals,
        have been identified for this gene. [provided by R. Dalgleish, Feb 2008]


        COL3A1: This gene encodes the pro-alpha1 chains of type III collagen, a fibrillar
        collagen that is found in extensible connective tissues such as skin, lung,
        uterus, intestine and the vascular system, frequently in association with
        type I collagen. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos
        syndrome type IV, and with aortic and arterial aneurysms. [provided by R.
        Dalgleish, Feb 2008]


        COL5A1: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar
        collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of
        one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing
        type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers
        composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely
        related to type XI collagen and it is possible that the collagen chains of
        types V and XI constitute a single collagen type with tissue-specific chain
        combinations. The encoded procollagen protein occurs commonly as the heterotrimer
        pro-alpha1(V)-pro-alpha1(V)-pro-alpha2(V). Mutations in this gene are associated
        with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, types I and II. Alternative splicing of this
        gene results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2013]

        ZNF469: This gene encodes a zinc-finger protein. Low-percent homology to certain
        collagens suggests that it may function as a transcription factor or extra-nuclear
        regulator factor for the synthesis or organization of collagen fibers. Mutations

        CHST14: This gene encodes a member of the HNK-1 family of sulfotransferases.
        The encoded protein transfers sulfate to the C-4 hydroxyl of N-acetylgalactosamine
        residues in dermatan sulfate. Mutations in this gene have been associated
        with adducted thumb-clubfoot syndrome.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2010]


        AEBP1: This gene encodes a member of carboxypeptidase A protein family. The
        encoded protein may function as a transcriptional repressor and play a role
        in adipogenesis and smooth muscle cell differentiation. Studies in mice suggest
        that this gene functions in wound healing and abdominal wall development.
        Overexpression of this gene is associated with glioblastoma. [provided by
        RefSeq, May 2013]


        PLOD1: Lysyl hydroxylase is a membrane-bound homodimeric protein localized
        to the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum. The enzyme (cofactors iron
        and ascorbate) catalyzes the hydroxylation of lysyl residues in collagen-like
        peptides. The resultant hydroxylysyl groups are attachment sites for carbohydrates
        in collagen and thus are critical for the stability of intermolecular crosslinks.
        Some patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VI have deficiencies in lysyl
        hydroxylase activity. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms
        have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        B4GALT7: This gene is a member of the beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT)
        family. Family members encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear
        to have exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose. Each
        beta4GalT member has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different
        glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they
        have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to
        the Golgi apparatus which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane
        anchor. The enzyme encoded by this gene attaches the first galactose in the
        common carbohydrate-protein linkage (GlcA-beta1,3-Gal-beta1,3-Gal-beta1,4-Xyl-beta1-O-Ser)
        found in proteoglycans. This enzyme differs from other beta4GalTs because
        it lacks the conserved Cys residues found in beta4GalT1-beta4GalT6 and it
        is located in cis-Golgi instead of trans-Golgi. Mutations in this gene have
        been associated with the progeroid form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. [provided
        by RefSeq, Oct 2009]


        PRDM5: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcription factor of the PR-domain
        protein family. It contains a PR-domain and multiple zinc finger motifs. Transcription
        factors of the PR-domain family are known to be involved in cell differentiation
        and tumorigenesis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        TNXB: This gene encodes a member of the tenascin family of extracellular matrix
        glycoproteins. The tenascins have anti-adhesive effects, as opposed to fibronectin
        which is adhesive. This protein is thought to function in matrix maturation
        during wound healing, and its deficiency has been associated with the connective
        tissue disorder Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This gene localizes to the major histocompatibility
        complex (MHC) class III region on chromosome 6. It is one of four genes in
        this cluster which have been duplicated. The duplicated copy of this gene
        is incomplete and is a pseudogene which is transcribed but does not encode
        a protein. The structure of this gene is unusual in that it overlaps the CREBL1
        and CYP21A2 genes at its 5'' and 3'' ends, respectively. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        C1R: This gene encodes a member of the peptidase S1 protein family. The encoded
        protein is a proteolytic subunit in the complement system C1 complex. The
        complement system acts as a mediator in the innate immune response by ultimately
        triggering phagocytosis, inflammation, and rupturing the bacterial cell wall.
        Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. [provided
        by RefSeq, Dec 2018]


        C1S: This gene encodes a serine protease, which is a major constituent of
        the human complement subcomponent C1. C1s associates with two other complement
        components C1r and C1q in order to yield the first component of the serum
        complement system. Defects in this gene are the cause of selective C1s deficiency.
        [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2009]


        B3GALT6: The enzyme encoded by this intronless gene is a beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase
        found in the medial Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the transfer of galactose
        from UDP-galactose to substrates containing a terminal beta-linked galactose
        moiety. The encoded enzyme has a particular affinity for galactose-beta-1,4-xylose
        found in the linker region of glycosamines. This enzyme is required for glycosaminoglycan
        synthesis. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2013]


        FKBP14: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the FK506-binding
        protein family of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases. The encoded protein
        is found in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is thought to
        accelerate protein folding. Defects in this gene are a cause of a type of
        Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Both a protein-coding variant and noncoding
        variants are transcribed from this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012]


        SLC39A13: This gene encodes a member of the LIV-1 subfamily of the ZIP transporter
        family. The encoded transmembrane protein functions as a zinc transporter.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with the spondylocheiro dysplastic
        form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Alternate transcript variants have been found
        for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2016]


        DSE: The protein encoded by this gene is a tumor-rejection antigen. It is
        localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and functions to convert D-glucuronic
        acid to L-iduronic acid during the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate. This
        antigen possesses tumor epitopes capable of inducing HLA-A24-restricted and
        tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in cancer patients and may be useful
        for specific immunotherapy. Mutations in this gene cause inmusculocontractural
        Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. A related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 9, and a
        paralogous gene exists on chromosome 18. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2016]


        COL12A1: This gene encodes the alpha chain of type XII collagen, a member
        of the FACIT (fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices)
        collagen family. Type XII collagen is a homotrimer found in association with
        type I collagen, an association that is thought to modify the interactions
        between collagen I fibrils and the surrounding matrix. Alternatively spliced
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ADAMTS2: This gene encodes a member of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase
        with thrombospondin motifs) protein family. Members of the family share several
        distinct protein modules, including a propeptide region, a metalloproteinase
        domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and a thrombospondin type 1 (TS) motif.
        Individual members of this family differ in the number of C-terminal TS motifs,
        and some have unique C-terminal domains. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically
        processed to generate the mature procollagen N-proteinase. This proteinase
        excises the N-propeptide of the fibrillar procollagens types I-III and type
        V. Mutations in this gene cause Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC, a recessively
        inherited connective-tissue disorder. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically
        processed. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        COL1A2: This gene encodes the pro-alpha2 chain of type I collagen whose triple
        helix comprises two alpha1 chains and one alpha2 chain. Type I is a fibril-forming
        collagen found in most connective tissues and is abundant in bone, cornea,
        dermis and tendon. Mutations in this gene are associated with osteogenesis
        imperfecta types I-IV, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIB, recessive Ehlers-Danlos
        syndrome Classical type, idiopathic osteoporosis, and atypical Marfan syndrome.
        Symptoms associated with mutations in this gene, however, tend to be less
        severe than mutations in the gene for the alpha1 chain of type I collagen
        (COL1A1) reflecting the different role of alpha2 chains in matrix integrity.
        Three transcripts, resulting from the use of alternate polyadenylation signals,
        have been identified for this gene. [provided by R. Dalgleish, Feb 2008]


        COL3A1: This gene encodes the pro-alpha1 chains of type III collagen, a fibrillar
        collagen that is found in extensible connective tissues such as skin, lung,
        uterus, intestine and the vascular system, frequently in association with
        type I collagen. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos
        syndrome type IV, and with aortic and arterial aneurysms. [provided by R.
        Dalgleish, Feb 2008]


        COL5A1: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar
        collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of
        one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing
        type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers
        composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely
        related to type XI collagen and it is possible that the collagen chains of
        types V and XI constitute a single collagen type with tissue-specific chain
        combinations. The encoded procollagen protein occurs commonly as the heterotrimer
        pro-alpha1(V)-pro-alpha1(V)-pro-alpha2(V). Mutations in this gene are associated
        with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, types I and II. Alternative splicing of this
        gene results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2013]


        COL5A2: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar

        combinations. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
        types I and II. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ZNF469: This gene encodes a zinc-finger protein. Low-percent homology to certain
        collagens suggests that it may function as a transcription factor or extra-nuclear
        regulator factor for the synthesis or organization of collagen fibers. Mutations
        in this gene cause brittle cornea syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        CHST14: This gene encodes a member of the HNK-1 family of sulfotransferases.
        The encoded protein transfers sulfate to the C-4 hydroxyl of N-acetylgalactosamine

        Here are the gene summaries:



        B4GALT7: This gene is a member of the beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT)
        family. Family members encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear
        to have exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose. Each
        beta4GalT member has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different
        glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they
        have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to
        the Golgi apparatus which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane
        anchor. The enzyme encoded by this gene attaches the first galactose in the
        common carbohydrate-protein linkage (GlcA-beta1,3-Gal-beta1,3-Gal-beta1,4-Xyl-beta1-O-Ser)
        found in proteoglycans. This enzyme differs from other beta4GalTs because
        it lacks the conserved Cys residues found in beta4GalT1-beta4GalT6 and it
        is located in cis-Golgi instead of trans-Golgi. Mutations in this gene have
        been associated with the progeroid form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. [provided
        by RefSeq, Oct 2009]


        C1R: This gene encodes a member of the peptidase S1 protein family. The encoded
        protein is a proteolytic subunit in the complement system C1 complex. The
        complement system acts as a mediator in the innate immune response by ultimately
        triggering phagocytosis, inflammation, and rupturing the bacterial cell wall.
        Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. [provided
        by RefSeq, Dec 2018]


        COL5A2: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar
        collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of
        one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing
        type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers
        composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely
        related to type XI collagen and it is possible that the collagen chains of
        types V and XI constitute a single collagen type with tissue-specific chain
        combinations. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
        types I and II. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        C1S: This gene encodes a serine protease, which is a major constituent of
        the human complement subcomponent C1. C1s associates with two other complement
        components C1r and C1q in order to yield the first component of the serum
        complement system. Defects in this gene are the cause of selective C1s deficiency.
        [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2009]


        ADAMTS2: This gene encodes a member of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase
        with thrombospondin motifs) protein family. Members of the family share several
        distinct protein modules, including a propeptide region, a metalloproteinase
        domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and a thrombospondin type 1 (TS) motif.
        Individual members of this family differ in the number of C-terminal TS motifs,
        and some have unique C-terminal domains. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically
        processed to generate the mature procollagen N-proteinase. This proteinase
        excises the N-propeptide of the fibrillar procollagens types I-III and type
        V. Mutations in this gene cause Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC, a recessively
        inherited connective-tissue disorder. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically
        processed. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        DSE: The protein encoded by this gene is a tumor-rejection antigen. It is
        localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and functions to convert D-glucuronic
        acid to L-iduronic acid during the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate. This
        antigen possesses tumor epitopes capable of inducing HLA-A24-restricted and
        tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in cancer patients and may be useful
        for specific immunotherapy. Mutations in this gene cause inmusculocontractural
        Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. A related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 9, and a
        paralogous gene exists on chromosome 18. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2016]


        COL1A2: This gene encodes the pro-alpha2 chain of type I collagen whose triple
        helix comprises two alpha1 chains and one alpha2 chain. Type I is a fibril-forming
        collagen found in most connective tissues and is abundant in bone, cornea,
        dermis and tendon. Mutations in this gene are associated with osteogenesis
        imperfecta types I-IV, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIB, recessive Ehlers-Danlos
        syndrome Classical type, idiopathic osteoporosis, and atypical Marfan syndrome.
        Symptoms associated with mutations in this gene, however, tend to be less
        severe than mutations in the gene for the alpha1 chain of type I collagen
        (COL1A1) reflecting the different role of alpha2 chains in matrix integrity.
        Three transcripts, resulting from the use of alternate polyadenylation signals,
        have been identified for this gene. [provided by R. Dalgleish, Feb 2008]


        PRDM5: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcription factor of the PR-domain
        protein family. It contains a PR-domain and multiple zinc finger motifs. Transcription
        factors of the PR-domain family are known to be involved in cell differentiation
        and tumorigenesis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FKBP14: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the FK506-binding
        protein family of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases. The encoded protein
        is found in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is thought to
        accelerate protein folding. Defects in this gene are a cause of a type of
        Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Both a protein-coding variant and noncoding
        variants are transcribed from this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012]


        COL5A1: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar
        collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of
        one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing
        type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers
        composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely
        related to type XI collagen and it is possible that the collagen chains of
        types V and XI constitute a single collagen type with tissue-specific chain
        combinations. The encoded procollagen protein occurs commonly as the heterotrimer
        pro-alpha1(V)-pro-alpha1(V)-pro-alpha2(V). Mutations in this gene are associated
        with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, types I and II. Alternative splicing of this
        gene results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2013]


        AEBP1: This gene encodes a member of carboxypeptidase A protein family. The
        encoded protein may function as a transcriptional repressor and play a role
        in adipogenesis and smooth muscle cell differentiation. Studies in mice suggest
        that this gene functions in wound healing and abdominal wall development.
        Overexpression of this gene is associated with glioblastoma. [provided by
        RefSeq, May 2013]


        TNXB: This gene encodes a member of the tenascin family of extracellular matrix
        glycoproteins. The tenascins have anti-adhesive effects, as opposed to fibronectin
        which is adhesive. This protein is thought to function in matrix maturation
        during wound healing, and its deficiency has been associated with the connective
        tissue disorder Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This gene localizes to the major histocompatibility
        complex (MHC) class III region on chromosome 6. It is one of four genes in
        this cluster which have been duplicated. The duplicated copy of this gene
        is incomplete and is a pseudogene which is transcribed but does not encode
        a protein. The structure of this gene is unusual in that it overlaps the CREBL1
        and CYP21A2 genes at its 5'' and 3'' ends, respectively. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ZNF469: This gene encodes a zinc-finger protein. Low-percent homology to certain
        collagens suggests that it may function as a transcription factor or extra-nuclear
        regulator factor for the synthesis or organization of collagen fibers. Mutations
        in this gene cause brittle cornea syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        CHST14: This gene encodes a member of the HNK-1 family of sulfotransferases.
        The encoded protein transfers sulfate to the C-4 hydroxyl of N-acetylgalactosamine
        residues in dermatan sulfate. Mutations in this gene have been associated
        with adducted thumb-clubfoot syndrome.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2010]


        COL12A1: This gene encodes the alpha chain of type XII collagen, a member
        of the FACIT (fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices)
        collagen family. Type XII collagen is a homotrimer found in association with
        type I collagen, an association that is thought to modify the interactions
        between collagen I fibrils and the surrounding matrix. Alternatively spliced
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        B3GALT6: The enzyme encoded by this intronless gene is a beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase
        found in the medial Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the transfer of galactose
        from UDP-galactose to substrates containing a terminal beta-linked galactose
        moiety. The encoded enzyme has a particular affinity for galactose-beta-1,4-xylose
        found in the linker region of glycosamines. This enzyme is required for glycosaminoglycan
        synthesis. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2013]


        PLOD1: Lysyl hydroxylase is a membrane-bound homodimeric protein localized
        to the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum. The enzyme (cofactors iron
        and ascorbate) catalyzes the hydroxylation of lysyl residues in collagen-like
        peptides. The resultant hydroxylysyl groups are attachment sites for carbohydrates
        in collagen and thus are critical for the stability of intermolecular crosslinks.
        Some patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VI have deficiencies in lysyl
        hydroxylase activity. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms
        have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        SLC39A13: This gene encodes a member of the LIV-1 subfamily of the ZIP transporter
        family. The encoded transmembrane protein functions as a zinc transporter.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with the spondylocheiro dysplastic
        form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Alternate transcript variants have been found
        for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2016]

        and regulation of collagen, a key component of connective tissue. Mutations
        in these genes are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a group of genetic
        disorders that affect collagen production and cause hypermobility of joints,
        skin elasticity, and tissue fragility.


        Mechanism: The genes listed are involved in collagen biosynthesis and regulation,
        suggesting that deficiencies or mutations in these genes could lead to abnormal
        or insufficient collagen production, ultimately resulting in connective tissue
        disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.



        Hypothesis:  The genes listed may converge on a pathway that regulates the
        synthesis, assembly, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix, particularly
        with respect to collagen and other fibrillar components. Defects or deficiencies
        in this pathway could lead to dysregulation of tissue remodeling and repair,
        resulting in connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.'

        Here are the gene summaries:



        B4GALT7: This gene is a member of the beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT)
        family. Family members encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear
        to have exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose. Each
        beta4GalT member has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different
        glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they
        have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to
        the Golgi apparatus which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane
        anchor. The enzyme encoded by this gene attaches the first galactose in the
        common carbohydrate-protein linkage (GlcA-beta1,3-Gal-beta1,3-Gal-beta1,4-Xyl-beta1-O-Ser)
        found in proteoglycans. This enzyme differs from other beta4GalTs because
        it lacks the conserved Cys residues found in beta4GalT1-beta4GalT6 and it
        is located in cis-Golgi instead of trans-Golgi. Mutations in this gene have
        been associated with the progeroid form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. [provided
        by RefSeq, Oct 2009]


        C1R: This gene encodes a member of the peptidase S1 protein family. The encoded
        protein is a proteolytic subunit in the complement system C1 complex. The
        complement system acts as a mediator in the innate immune response by ultimately
        triggering phagocytosis, inflammation, and rupturing the bacterial cell wall.
        Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. [provided
        by RefSeq, Dec 2018]


        COL5A2: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar
        collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of
        one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing
        type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers
        composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely
        related to type XI collagen and it is possible that the collagen chains of
        types V and XI constitute a single collagen type with tissue-specific chain
        combinations. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
        types I and II. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        C1S: This gene encodes a serine protease, which is a major constituent of
        the human complement subcomponent C1. C1s associates with two other complement
        components C1r and C1q in order to yield the first component of the serum
        complement system. Defects in this gene are the cause of selective C1s deficiency.
        [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2009]


        ADAMTS2: This gene encodes a member of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase
        with thrombospondin motifs) protein family. Members of the family share several
        distinct protein modules, including a propeptide region, a metalloproteinase
        domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and a thrombospondin type 1 (TS) motif.
        Individual members of this family differ in the number of C-terminal TS motifs,
        and some have unique C-terminal domains. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically
        processed to generate the mature procollagen N-proteinase. This proteinase
        excises the N-propeptide of the fibrillar procollagens types I-III and type
        V. Mutations in this gene cause Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC, a recessively
        inherited connective-tissue disorder. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically
        processed. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        DSE: The protein encoded by this gene is a tumor-rejection antigen. It is
        localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and functions to convert D-glucuronic
        acid to L-iduronic acid during the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate. This
        antigen possesses tumor epitopes capable of inducing HLA-A24-restricted and
        tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in cancer patients and may be useful
        for specific immunotherapy. Mutations in this gene cause inmusculocontractural
        Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. A related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 9, and a
        paralogous gene exists on chromosome 18. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2016]


        COL1A2: This gene encodes the pro-alpha2 chain of type I collagen whose triple
        helix comprises two alpha1 chains and one alpha2 chain. Type I is a fibril-forming
        collagen found in most connective tissues and is abundant in bone, cornea,
        dermis and tendon. Mutations in this gene are associated with osteogenesis
        imperfecta types I-IV, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIB, recessive Ehlers-Danlos
        syndrome Classical type, idiopathic osteoporosis, and atypical Marfan syndrome.
        Symptoms associated with mutations in this gene, however, tend to be less
        severe than mutations in the gene for the alpha1 chain of type I collagen
        (COL1A1) reflecting the different role of alpha2 chains in matrix integrity.
        Three transcripts, resulting from the use of alternate polyadenylation signals,
        have been identified for this gene. [provided by R. Dalgleish, Feb 2008]


        PRDM5: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcription factor of the PR-domain
        protein family. It contains a PR-domain and multiple zinc finger motifs. Transcription
        factors of the PR-domain family are known to be involved in cell differentiation
        and tumorigenesis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FKBP14: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the FK506-binding
        protein family of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases. The encoded protein
        is found in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is thought to
        accelerate protein folding. Defects in this gene are a cause of a type of
        Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Both a protein-coding variant and noncoding
        variants are transcribed from this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012]


        COL5A1: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar
        collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of
        one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing
        type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers
        composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely
        related to type XI collagen and it is possible that the collagen chains of
        types V and XI constitute a single collagen type with tissue-specific chain
        combinations. The encoded procollagen protein occurs commonly as the heterotrimer
        pro-alpha1(V)-pro-alpha1(V)-pro-alpha2(V). Mutations in this gene are associated
        with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, types I and II. Alternative splicing of this
        gene results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2013]


        AEBP1: This gene encodes a member of carboxypeptidase A protein family. The
        encoded protein may function as a transcriptional repressor and play a role
        in adipogenesis and smooth muscle cell differentiation. Studies in mice suggest
        that this gene functions in wound healing and abdominal wall development.
        Overexpression of this gene is associated with glioblastoma. [provided by
        RefSeq, May 2013]


        TNXB: This gene encodes a member of the tenascin family of extracellular matrix
        glycoproteins. The tenascins have anti-adhesive effects, as opposed to fibronectin
        which is adhesive. This protein is thought to function in matrix maturation
        during wound healing, and its deficiency has been associated with the connective
        tissue disorder Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This gene localizes to the major histocompatibility
        complex (MHC) class III region on chromosome 6. It is one of four genes in
        this cluster which have been duplicated. The duplicated copy of this gene
        is incomplete and is a pseudogene which is transcribed but does not encode
        a protein. The structure of this gene is unusual in that it overlaps the CREBL1
        and CYP21A2 genes at its 5'' and 3'' ends, respectively. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ZNF469: This gene encodes a zinc-finger protein. Low-percent homology to certain
        collagens suggests that it may function as a transcription factor or extra-nuclear
        regulator factor for the synthesis or organization of collagen fibers. Mutations
        in this gene cause brittle cornea syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        CHST14: This gene encodes a member of the HNK-1 family of sulfotransferases.
        The encoded protein transfers sulfate to the C-4 hydroxyl of N-acetylgalactosamine
        residues in dermatan sulfate. Mutations in this gene have been associated
        with adducted thumb-clubfoot syndrome.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2010]


        COL12A1: This gene encodes the alpha chain of type XII collagen, a member
        of the FACIT (fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices)
        collagen family. Type XII collagen is a homotrimer found in association with
        type I collagen, an association that is thought to modify the interactions
        between collagen I fibrils and the surrounding matrix. Alternatively spliced
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        B3GALT6: The enzyme encoded by this intronless gene is a beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase
        found in the medial Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the transfer of galactose
        from UDP-galactose to substrates containing a terminal beta-linked galactose
        moiety. The encoded enzyme has a particular affinity for galactose-beta-1,4-xylose
        found in the linker region of glycosamines. This enzyme is required for glycosaminoglycan
        synthesis. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2013]


        PLOD1: Lysyl hydroxylase is a membrane-bound homodimeric protein localized
        to the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum. The enzyme (cofactors iron
        and ascorbate) catalyzes the hydroxylation of lysyl residues in collagen-like
        peptides. The resultant hydroxylysyl groups are attachment sites for carbohydrates
        in collagen and thus are critical for the stability of intermolecular crosslinks.
        Some patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VI have deficiencies in lysyl
        hydroxylase activity. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms
        have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        SLC39A13: This gene encodes a member of the LIV-1 subfamily of the ZIP transporter
        family. The encoded transmembrane protein functions as a zinc transporter.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with the spondylocheiro dysplastic
        form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Alternate transcript variants have been found
        for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2016]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        B4GALT7: This gene is a member of the beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT)
        family. Family members encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear
        to have exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose. Each
        beta4GalT member has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different
        glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they
        have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to
        the Golgi apparatus which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane
        anchor. The enzyme encoded by this gene attaches the first galactose in the
        common carbohydrate-protein linkage (GlcA-beta1,3-Gal-beta1,3-Gal-beta1,4-Xyl-beta1-O-Ser)
        found in proteoglycans. This enzyme differs from other beta4GalTs because
        it lacks the conserved Cys residues found in beta4GalT1-beta4GalT6 and it
        is located in cis-Golgi instead of trans-Golgi. Mutations in this gene have
        been associated with the progeroid form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. [provided
        by RefSeq, Oct 2009]


        C1R: This gene encodes a member of the peptidase S1 protein family. The encoded
        protein is a proteolytic subunit in the complement system C1 complex. The
        complement system acts as a mediator in the innate immune response by ultimately
        triggering phagocytosis, inflammation, and rupturing the bacterial cell wall.
        Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. [provided
        by RefSeq, Dec 2018]


        COL5A2: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar
        collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of
        one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing
        type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers
        composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely
        related to type XI collagen and it is possible that the collagen chains of
        types V and XI constitute a single collagen type with tissue-specific chain
        combinations. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
        types I and II. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        C1S: This gene encodes a serine protease, which is a major constituent of
        the human complement subcomponent C1. C1s associates with two other complement
        components C1r and C1q in order to yield the first component of the serum
        complement system. Defects in this gene are the cause of selective C1s deficiency.
        [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2009]


        ADAMTS2: This gene encodes a member of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase
        with thrombospondin motifs) protein family. Members of the family share several
        distinct protein modules, including a propeptide region, a metalloproteinase
        domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and a thrombospondin type 1 (TS) motif.
        Individual members of this family differ in the number of C-terminal TS motifs,
        and some have unique C-terminal domains. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically
        processed to generate the mature procollagen N-proteinase. This proteinase
        excises the N-propeptide of the fibrillar procollagens types I-III and type
        V. Mutations in this gene cause Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC, a recessively
        inherited connective-tissue disorder. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically
        processed. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        DSE: The protein encoded by this gene is a tumor-rejection antigen. It is
        localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and functions to convert D-glucuronic
        acid to L-iduronic acid during the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate. This
        antigen possesses tumor epitopes capable of inducing HLA-A24-restricted and
        tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in cancer patients and may be useful
        for specific immunotherapy. Mutations in this gene cause inmusculocontractural
        Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. A related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 9, and a
        paralogous gene exists on chromosome 18. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2016]


        COL1A2: This gene encodes the pro-alpha2 chain of type I collagen whose triple
        helix comprises two alpha1 chains and one alpha2 chain. Type I is a fibril-forming
        collagen found in most connective tissues and is abundant in bone, cornea,
        dermis and tendon. Mutations in this gene are associated with osteogenesis
        imperfecta types I-IV, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIB, recessive Ehlers-Danlos
        syndrome Classical type, idiopathic osteoporosis, and atypical Marfan syndrome.
        Symptoms associated with mutations in this gene, however, tend to be less
        severe than mutations in the gene for the alpha1 chain of type I collagen
        (COL1A1) reflecting the different role of alpha2 chains in matrix integrity.
        Three transcripts, resulting from the use of alternate polyadenylation signals,
        have been identified for this gene. [provided by R. Dalgleish, Feb 2008]


        PRDM5: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcription factor of the PR-domain
        protein family. It contains a PR-domain and multiple zinc finger motifs. Transcription
        factors of the PR-domain family are known to be involved in cell differentiation
        and tumorigenesis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        FKBP14: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the FK506-binding
        protein family of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases. The encoded protein
        is found in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is thought to
        accelerate protein folding. Defects in this gene are a cause of a type of
        Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Both a protein-coding variant and noncoding
        variants are transcribed from this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012]


        COL5A1: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar
        collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of
        one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing
        type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers
        composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely
        related to type XI collagen and it is possible that the collagen chains of
        types V and XI constitute a single collagen type with tissue-specific chain
        combinations. The encoded procollagen protein occurs commonly as the heterotrimer
        pro-alpha1(V)-pro-alpha1(V)-pro-alpha2(V). Mutations in this gene are associated
        with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, types I and II. Alternative splicing of this
        gene results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2013]


        AEBP1: This gene encodes a member of carboxypeptidase A protein family. The
        encoded protein may function as a transcriptional repressor and play a role
        in adipogenesis and smooth muscle cell differentiation. Studies in mice suggest
        that this gene functions in wound healing and abdominal wall development.
        Overexpression of this gene is associated with glioblastoma. [provided by
        RefSeq, May 2013]


        TNXB: This gene encodes a member of the tenascin family of extracellular matrix
        glycoproteins. The tenascins have anti-adhesive effects, as opposed to fibronectin
        which is adhesive. This protein is thought to function in matrix maturation
        during wound healing, and its deficiency has been associated with the connective
        tissue disorder Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This gene localizes to the major histocompatibility
        complex (MHC) class III region on chromosome 6. It is one of four genes in
        this cluster which have been duplicated. The duplicated copy of this gene
        is incomplete and is a pseudogene which is transcribed but does not encode
        a protein. The structure of this gene is unusual in that it overlaps the CREBL1
        and CYP21A2 genes at its 5'' and 3'' ends, respectively. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        ZNF469: This gene encodes a zinc-finger protein. Low-percent homology to certain
        collagens suggests that it may function as a transcription factor or extra-nuclear
        regulator factor for the synthesis or organization of collagen fibers. Mutations
        in this gene cause brittle cornea syndrome. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        CHST14: This gene encodes a member of the HNK-1 family of sulfotransferases.
        The encoded protein transfers sulfate to the C-4 hydroxyl of N-acetylgalactosamine
        residues in dermatan sulfate. Mutations in this gene have been associated
        with adducted thumb-clubfoot syndrome.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2010]


        COL12A1: This gene encodes the alpha chain of type XII collagen, a member
        of the FACIT (fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices)
        collagen family. Type XII collagen is a homotrimer found in association with
        type I collagen, an association that is thought to modify the interactions
        between collagen I fibrils and the surrounding matrix. Alternatively spliced
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided
        by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        B3GALT6: The enzyme encoded by this intronless gene is a beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase
        found in the medial Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the transfer of galactose
        from UDP-galactose to substrates containing a terminal beta-linked galactose
        moiety. The encoded enzyme has a particular affinity for galactose-beta-1,4-xylose
        found in the linker region of glycosamines. This enzyme is required for glycosaminoglycan
        synthesis. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2013]


        PLOD1: Lysyl hydroxylase is a membrane-bound homodimeric protein localized
        to the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum. The enzyme (cofactors iron
        and ascorbate) catalyzes the hydroxylation of lysyl residues in collagen-like
        peptides. The resultant hydroxylysyl groups are attachment sites for carbohydrates
        in collagen and thus are critical for the stability of intermolecular crosslinks.
        Some patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VI have deficiencies in lysyl
        hydroxylase activity. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms
        have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]


        SLC39A13: This gene encodes a member of the LIV-1 subfamily of the ZIP transporter
        family. The encoded transmembrane protein functions as a zinc transporter.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with the spondylocheiro dysplastic
        form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Alternate transcript variants have been found
        for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2016]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        B4GALT7: This gene is a member of the beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT)
        family. Family members encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear
        to have exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose. Each
        beta4GalT member has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different
        glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they
        have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to
        the Golgi apparatus which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane
        anchor. The enzyme encoded by this gene attaches the first galactose in the
        common carbohydrate-protein linkage (GlcA-beta1,3-Gal-beta1,3-Gal-beta1,4-Xyl-beta1-O-Ser)
        found in proteoglycans. This enzyme differs from other beta4GalTs because
        it lacks the conserved Cys residues found in beta4GalT1-beta4GalT6 and it
        is located in cis-Golgi instead of trans-Golgi. Mutations in this gene have
        been associated with the progeroid form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. [provided
        by RefSeq, Oct 2009]


        C1R: This gene encodes a member of the peptidase S1 protein family. The encoded
        protein is a proteolytic subunit in the complement system C1 complex. The
        complement system acts as a mediator in the innate immune response by ultimately
        triggering phagocytosis, inflammation, and rupturing the bacterial cell wall.
        Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. [provided
        by RefSeq, Dec 2018]


        COL5A2: This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar
        collagens. Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of
        one or more types of alpha chains. Type V collagen is found in tissues containing
        type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers
        composed of both type I and type V collagen. This gene product is closely
        related to type XI collagen and it is possible that the collagen chains of
        types V and XI constitute a single collagen type with tissue-specific chain
        combinations. Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
        types I and II. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        C1S: This gene encodes a serine protease, which is a major constituent of
        the human complement subcomponent C1. C1s associates with two other complement
        components C1r and C1q in order to yield the first component of the serum
        complement system. Defects in this gene are the cause of selective C1s deficiency.
        [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2009]


        ADAMTS2: This gene encodes a member of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase
        with thrombospondin motifs) protein family. Members of the family share several
        distinct protein modules, including a propeptide region, a metalloproteinase
        domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and a thrombospondin type 1 (TS) motif.
        Individual members of this family differ in the number of C-terminal TS motifs,
        and some have unique C-terminal domains. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically
        processed to generate the mature procollagen N-proteinase. This proteinase
        excises the N-propeptide of the fibrillar procollagens types I-III and type
        V. Mutations in this gene cause Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC, a recessively
        inherited connective-tissue disorder. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically
        processed. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        DSE: The protein encoded by this gene is a tumor-rejection antigen. It is
        localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and functions to convert D-glucuronic
        acid to L-iduronic acid during the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate. This
        antigen possesses tumor epitopes capable of inducing HLA-A24-restricted and
        tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in cancer patients and may be useful
        for specific immunotherapy. Mutations in this gene cause inmusculocontractural
        Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
        variants. A related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 9, and a
        paralogous gene exists on chromosome 18. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2016]


        COL1A2: This gene encodes the pro-alpha2 chain of type I collagen whose triple
        helix comprises two alpha1 chains and one alpha2 chain. Type I is a fibril-forming
        collagen found in most connective tissues and is abundant in bone, cornea,
        dermis and tendon. Mutations in this gene are associated with osteogenesis
        imperfecta types I-IV, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIB, recessive Ehlers-Danlos
        syndrome Classical type, idiopathic osteoporosis, and atypical Marfan syndrome.
        Symptoms associated with mutations in this gene, however, tend to be less
        severe than mutations in the gene for the alpha1 chain of type I collagen
        (COL1A1) reflecting the different role of alpha2 chains in matrix integrity.
        Three transcripts, resulting from the use of alternate polyadenylation signals,
        have been identified for this gene. [provided by R. Dalgleish, Feb 2008]


        PRDM5: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcription factor of the PR-domain
        protein family. It contains a PR-domain and multiple zinc finger motifs. Transcription
        factors of the PR-domain family are known to be involved in cell differentiation
        and tumorigenesis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
