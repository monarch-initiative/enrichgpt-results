        Enriched terms: apoptotic process; programmed cell death; regulation of cell
        death


        Mechanism: These genes are involved in various processes that regulate cell
        death. They participate in the apoptotic process, the programmed cell death
        that occurs in multicellular organisms. Apoptosis is a complex physiological
        process that is essential for development and homeostasis in healthy adult
        tissues. These genes also contribute to the regulation of cell death, preventing
        or promoting apoptosis under specific conditions.


        Hypothesis: The genes on this list may interact with each other to form signaling
        pathways that regulate the balance between cell survival and death. Dysregulation
        of these pathways can lead to pathological conditions such as cancer. Further
        studies are needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms and interactions among
        these genes in the context of cell death regulation.'

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

      response_text: 'Summary: Genes involved in apoptotic signaling and cytokine
        activity.


        Enriched Terms: apoptotic process; cytokine activity; regulation of cell death;
        regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway; positive regulation of cytokine
        production; regulation of apoptosis; regulation of programmed cell death;
        positive regulation of apoptotic process.


        Mechanism: These genes are involved in apoptotic signaling and cytokine activity,
        which suggests that they play a role in regulating cell death and programmed
        cell death. The enriched terms suggest that these genes may be regulated by
        shared signaling pathways or transcriptional programs that control apoptosis
        and cytokine production. One potential underlying mechanism could involve
        the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins in response to cellular stress or
        damage, leading to the release of cytokines that further promote cell death.
        Alternatively, these genes may be involved in controlling the balance between
        cell survival and death in response to external cues such as cytokine signaling
        or nutrient availability. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the
        molecular mechanisms underlying these gene functions.'

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.
