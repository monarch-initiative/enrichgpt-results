        receptors are heterotetramers of seven genetically encoded, differentially
        expressed subunits including NR1 (GRIN1), NR2 (GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, or
        GRIN2D) and NR3 (GRIN3A or GRIN3B). The early expression of this gene in development

        gene are a cause of familial persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy
        (PHHI), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by unregulated insulin
        secretion. Defects in this gene may also contribute to autosomal dominant

        KCNMB4: MaxiK channels are large conductance, voltage and calcium-sensitive
        potassium channels which are fundamental to the control of smooth muscle tone
        and neuronal excitability. MaxiK channels can be formed by 2 subunits: the
        pore-forming alpha subunit and the modulatory beta subunit. The protein encoded

        SCN1A: Voltage-dependent sodium channels are heteromeric complexes that regulate
        sodium exchange between intracellular and extracellular spaces and are essential
        for the generation and propagation of action potentials in muscle cells and
        neurons. Each sodium channel is composed of a large pore-forming, glycosylated
        alpha subunit and two smaller beta subunits. This gene encodes a sodium channel
        alpha subunit, which has four homologous domains, each of which contains six
        transmembrane regions. Allelic variants of this gene are associated with generalized

        KCNMB4: MaxiK channels are large conductance, voltage and calcium-sensitive
        potassium channels which are fundamental to the control of smooth muscle tone
        and neuronal excitability. MaxiK channels can be formed by 2 subunits: the
        pore-forming alpha subunit and the modulatory beta subunit. The protein encoded
        by this gene is an auxiliary beta subunit which slows activation kinetics,
        leads to steeper calcium sensitivity, and shifts the voltage range...


        SCN10A: The protein encoded by this gene is a tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated
        sodium channel alpha subunit. The properties of the channel formed by the
        encoded transmembrane protein can be altered by interaction with different
        beta subunits. This protein may be involved in the onset of pain associated
        with peripheral neuropathy. Alternat...


        SCN1A: Voltage-dependent sodium channels are heteromeric complexes that regulate
        sodium exchange between intracellular and extracellular spaces and are essential
        for the generation and propagation of action potentials in muscle cells and
        neurons. Each sodium channel is composed of a large pore-forming, glycosylated
        alpha subunit and two smaller beta subunits. This gene encodes a sodium channel
        alpha subunit, which has four homologous domains, each of which contains six
        transmembrane regions. Allelic variants of this gene are associated with generalized
        epilepsy with febrile seizures and epileptic encephalopathy. Alternative splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants. The RefSeq Project has decided to
        create four representative RefSeq records. Three of the transcript variants
        are supported by experime...

        that mediate the voltage-dependent potassium ion permeability of excitable
        membranes. Alternative splicing is thought to result in two transcript variants
        encoding isoforms that differ at their C-termini. These isoforms have had
        conflicting names in the literature: the longer isoform has been called both
        "b" and "alpha", while the shorte...


        KCNC2: The Shaker gene family of Drosophila encodes components of voltage-gated
        potassium channels and is comprised of four subfamilies. Based on sequence
        similarity, this gene is similar to one of these subfamilies, namely the Shaw
        subfamily. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the delayed rectifier
        class of channel proteins and is an integral membrane protein that mediates
        the voltage-dependent potassium ion permeability of excitable membranes. Sev...


        KCNJ11: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they
        participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded
        by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium
        channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium
        to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins
        and is found associated with the sulfonylurea receptor SUR. Mutations in this
        gene are a cause of familial persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy
        (PHHI), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by unregulated insulin
        secretion. Defects in this gene may also contribute to autosomal dominant
        non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus type II (NIDDM), transient neonatal
        diabetes mellitus type 3 (TNDM3), and ...


        KCNJ3: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they
        participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded

        channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium
        to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins
        and plays an important role in regulating heartbeat. It associates with three
        other G-protein-activated potassium channels to form a heteromultimeric pore-forming
        complex that also couples to neurotransmitter receptors in the brain and whereby
        channel activation can inhibit action potential firing by hyperpolarizing
        the plasma membrane. These multimeric G-protein-gated inwardly-rectifying
        potassium (GIRK) channels may play a role in the path...

        KCNMB4: MaxiK channels are large conductance, voltage and calcium-sensitive
        potassium channels which are fundamental to the control of smooth muscle tone
        and neuronal excitability. MaxiK channels can be formed by 2 subunits: the
        pore-forming alpha subunit and the modulatory beta subunit. The protein encoded
        by this gene is an auxiliary beta subunit which slows activation kinetics,
        leads to steeper calcium sensitivity, and shifts the voltage range...


        SCN10A: The protein encoded by this gene is a tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated
        sodium channel alpha subunit. The properties of the channel formed by the
        encoded transmembrane protein can be altered by interaction with different
        beta subunits. This protein may be involved in the onset of pain associated
        with peripheral neuropathy. Alternat...


        SCN1A: Voltage-dependent sodium channels are heteromeric complexes that regulate
        sodium exchange between intracellular and extracellular spaces and are essential
        for the generation and propagation of action potentials in muscle cells and
        neurons. Each sodium channel is composed of a large pore-forming, glycosylated
        alpha subunit and two smaller beta subunits. This gene encodes a sodium channel
        alpha subunit, which has four homologous domains, each of which contains six
        transmembrane regions. Allelic variants of this gene are associated with generalized
        epilepsy with febrile seizures and epileptic encephalopathy. Alternative splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants. The RefSeq Project has decided to
        create four representative RefSeq records. Three of the transcript variants
        are supported by experime...

        KCNC1: This gene encodes a member of a family of integral membrane proteins
        that mediate the voltage-dependent potassium ion permeability of excitable
        membranes. Alternative splicing is thought to result in two transcript variants
        encoding isoforms that differ at their C-termini. These isoforms have had
        conflicting names in the literature: the longer isoform has been called both
        "b" and "alpha", while the shorte...


        KCNC2: The Shaker gene family of Drosophila encodes components of voltage-gated
        potassium channels and is comprised of four subfamilies. Based on sequence
        similarity, this gene is similar to one of these subfamilies, namely the Shaw
        subfamily. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the delayed rectifier
        class of channel proteins and is an integral membrane protein that mediates
        the voltage-dependent potassium ion permeability of excitable membranes. Sev...


        KCNJ11: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they
        participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded
        by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium
        channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium
        to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins
        and is found associated with the sulfonylurea receptor SUR. Mutations in this
        gene are a cause of familial persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy
        (PHHI), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by unregulated insulin
        secretion. Defects in this gene may also contribute to autosomal dominant
        non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus type II (NIDDM), transient neonatal
        diabetes mellitus type 3 (TNDM3), and ...


        KCNJ3: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they
        participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded
        by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium
        channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium
        to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins
        and plays an important role in regulating heartbeat. It associates with three
        other G-protein-activated potassium channels to form a heteromultimeric pore-forming
        complex that also couples to neurotransmitter receptors in the brain and whereby
        channel activation can inhibit action potential firing by hyperpolarizing
        the plasma membrane. These multimeric G-protein-gated inwardly-rectifying
        potassium (GIRK) channels may play a role in the path...


        KCNJ8: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they
        participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded
        by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium
        channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium
        to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins.
        Defects in this gene may b...


        KCNJ9: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they
        participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded
        by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium
        channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium
        to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins.
        It associates with another G-protein-act...


        KCNMB4: MaxiK channels are large conductance, voltage and calcium-sensitive
        potassium channels which are fundamental to the control of smooth muscle tone
        and neuronal excitability. MaxiK channels can be formed by 2 subunits: the
        pore-forming alpha subunit and the modulatory beta subunit. The protein encoded
        by this gene is an auxiliary beta subunit which slows activation kinetics,
        leads to steeper calcium sensitivity, and shifts the voltage range...


        SCN10A: The protein encoded by this gene is a tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated
        sodium channel alpha subunit. The properties of the channel formed by the
        encoded transmembrane protein can be altered by interaction with different
        beta subunits. This protein may be involved in the onset of pain associated
        with peripheral neuropathy. Alternat...


        SCN1A: Voltage-dependent sodium channels are heteromeric complexes that regulate
        sodium exchange between intracellular and extracellular spaces and are essential
        for the generation and propagation of action potentials in muscle cells and
        neurons. Each sodium channel is composed of a large pore-forming, glycosylated
        alpha subunit and two smaller beta subunits. This gene encodes a sodium channel
        alpha subunit, which has four homologous domains, each of which contains six
        transmembrane regions. Allelic variants of this gene are associated with generalized
        epilepsy with febrile seizures and epileptic encephalopathy. Alternative splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants. The RefSeq Project has decided to
        create four representative RefSeq records. Three of the transcript variants
        are supported by experime...

        receptors in the mammalian brain and are activated in a variety of normal
        neurophysiologic processes. These receptors are heteromeric protein complexes
        composed of multiple subunits, arranged to form ligand-gated ion channels.
        The classification of glutamate receptors is based on their activation by
        different pharmacologic agonists. The subunit encoded by this gene belongs
        to a family of AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate)-sensitive
        glutamate receptors, and is subject to RNA editing (AGA->GGA; R->G). Alternative
        splicing of this gene results in transcript variants encoding different i...


        GLRA1: The protein encoded by this gene is a subunit of a pentameric inhibitory
        glycine receptor, which mediates postsynaptic inhibition in the central nervous
        system. Defects in this gene are a cause of startle disease (STHE), also known
        as hereditary hyperekplexia or congenital stiff-person syndrome. Multiple
        transcript var...


        GABBR1: This gene encodes a receptor for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which
        is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system.
        This receptor functions as a heterodimer with GABA(B) receptor 2. Defects
        in this gene may underlie brain disorders such as schizophrenia and epilepsy.
        Alternative splicing generates multiple transcript variants, but the full-...

        receptors in the mammalian brain and are activated in a variety of normal
        neurophysiologic processes. These receptors are heteromeric protein complexes
        with multiple subunits, each possessing transmembrane regions, and all arranged
        to form a ligand-gated ion channel. The classification of glutamate receptors
        is based on their activation by different pharmacologic agonists. This gene
        belongs to a family of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate
        (AMPA) recept...


        KCNA2: Potassium channels represent the most complex class of voltage-gated
        ion channels from both functional and structural standpoints. Their diverse
        functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin
        secretion, neuronal excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth
        muscle contraction, and cell volume. Four sequence-related potassium channel
        genes - shaker, shaw, shab, and shal - have been identified in Drosophila,
        and each has been shown to have human homolog(s). This gene encodes a member
        of the potassium channel, voltage-gated, shaker-related subfamily. This member
        contains six membrane-spanning domains with a shaker-type repeat in the fourth
        segment. It belongs to the delayed rectifier class, members of which allow
        nerve cells to effici...


        KCNC1: This gene encodes a member of a family of integral membrane proteins
        that mediate the voltage-dependent potassium ion permeability of excitable
        membranes. Alternative splicing is thought to result in two transcript variants
        encoding isoforms that differ at their C-termini. These isoforms have had
        conflicting names in the literature: the longer isoform has been called both
        "b" and "alpha", while the shorte...


        GABRB2: The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor is a multisubunit chloride
        channel that mediates the fastest inhibitory synaptic transmission in the
        central nervous system. This gene encodes GABA A receptor, beta 2 subunit.
        It is mapped to chromosome 5q34 in a cluster comprised of genes encoding alpha
        1 and gamma 2 subunits of the GABA A receptor. Alternative splicing of this
        gene ...


        KCNJ8: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they
        participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded
        by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium
        channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium
        to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins.
        Defects in this gene may b...


        GRIN3B: The protein encoded by this gene is a subunit of an N-methyl-D-aspartate
        (NMDA) receptor. The encoded protein is found primarily in motor neurons,

        receptor. Variations in this gene have been pr...


        GRIN2D: N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are a class of ionotropic glutamate
        receptors. NMDA channel has been shown to be involved in long-term potentiation,
        an activity-dependent increase in the efficiency of synaptic transmission
        thought to underlie certain kinds of memory and learning. NMDA receptor channels
        are heteromers composed of the key receptor subunit NMDAR1 (GRIN1) and 1 or
        more of the 4 NMDAR2 subunits: N...


        GRIK3: Glutamate receptors are the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter
        receptors in the mammalian brain and are activated in a variety of normal
        neurophysiologic processes. This gene product belongs to the kainate family
        of glutamate receptors, which are composed of four subunits and function as
        ligand-activated ion channels. It is not certain if the subunit encoded by
        this gene is subject to RNA editing as the other 2 family members (GRIK1 and
        GRIK2). A Ser310Ala polymorphism has been associated with schizophrenia, and
        ther...


        KCNA1: This gene encodes a voltage-gated delayed potassium channel that is
        phylogenetically related to the Drosophila Shaker channel. The encoded protein
        has six putative transmembrane segments (S1-S6), and the loop between S5 and
        S6 forms the pore and contains the conserved selectivity filter motif (GYGD).
        The functional channel is a homotetramer. The N-terminus of the channel is
        associated with beta subunits that can modify the inactivation properties
        of the channel as well as affect expression levels. The C-terminus of the
        channel is complexed to a PDZ domain protein that is respon...

        participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded
        by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium
        channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium
        to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins
        and is found associated with the sulfonylurea receptor SUR. Mutations in this
        gene are a cause of familial persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy
        (PHHI), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by unregulated insulin
        secretion. Defects in this gene may also contribute to autosomal dominant
        non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus type II (NIDDM), transient neonatal
        diabetes mellitus type 3 (TNDM3), and ...


        GABRA2: GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain
        where it acts at GABA-A receptors, which are ligand-gated chloride channels.
        Chloride conductance of these channels can be modulated by agents such as
        benzodiazepines that bind to the GABA-A receptor. At least 16 distinct subunits
        of GABA-A receptors have been identified. Alternatively spliced transcript
        var...

        of glutamate receptors, which are composed of four subunits and function as
        ligand-activated ion channels. The subunit encoded by this gene is subject
        to RNA editing at multiple sites within the first and second transmembrane
        domains, which is thought to alter the structure and function of the receptor
        complex. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms

        encoding different isoforms...


        GRIK5: This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the glutamate-gated ionic
        channel family. Glutamate functions as the major excitatory neurotransmitter
        in the central nervous system through activation of ligand-gated ion channels
        and G protein-coupled membrane receptors. The protein encoded by this gene
        forms functional heteromeric kainate-preferring ionic channels with the subunits
        encoded by related gene famil...


        KCNJ3: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they
        participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded
        by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium
        channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium
        to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins
        and plays an important role in regulating heartbeat. It associates with three
        other G-protein-activated potassium channels to form a heteromultimeric pore-forming
        complex that also couples to neurotransmitter receptors in the brain and whereby
        channel activation can inhibit action potential firing by hyperpolarizing
        the plasma membrane. These multimeric G-protein-gated inwardly-rectifying
        potassium (GIRK) channels may play a role in the path...


        GABRB1: The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor is a multisubunit chloride

        SCN10A: The protein encoded by this gene is a tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated
        sodium channel alpha subunit. The properties of the channel formed by the
        encoded transmembrane protein can be altered by interaction with different
        beta subunits. This protein may be involved in the onset of pain associated
        with peripheral neuropathy. Alternat...


        KCNJ9: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they

        It associates with another G-protein-act...


        SCN1A: Voltage-dependent sodium channels are heteromeric complexes that regulate
        sodium exchange between intracellular and extracellular spaces and are essential
        for the generation and propagation of action potentials in muscle cells and
        neurons. Each sodium channel is composed of a large pore-forming, glycosylated
        alpha subunit and two smaller beta subunits. This gene encodes a sodium channel
        alpha subunit, which has four homologous domains, each of which contains six
        transmembrane regions. Allelic variants of this gene are associated with generalized
        epilepsy with febrile seizures and epileptic encephalopathy. Alternative splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants. The RefSeq Project has decided to
        create four representative RefSeq records. Three of the transcript variants

        GRIN2B: This gene encodes a member of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
        family within the ionotropic glutamate receptor superfamily. The encoded protein
        is a subunit of the NMDA receptor ion channel which acts as an agonist binding
        site for glutamate. The NMDA receptors mediate a slow calcium-permeable component
        of excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The NMDA
        receptors are heterotetramers of seven genetically encoded, differentially
        expressed subunits including NR1 (GRIN1), NR2 (GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, or
        GRIN2D) and NR3 (GRIN3A or GRIN3B). The early expression of this gene in development
        suggests a role in brain development, circuit formation, synaptic plasticity,
        and cellular migration and differentiation. Naturally occurring mutations
        within ...


        KCNC2: The Shaker gene family of Drosophila encodes components of voltage-gated
        potassium channels and is comprised of four subfamilies. Based on sequence
        similarity, this gene is similar to one of these subfamilies, namely the Shaw
        subfamily. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the delayed rectifier
        class of channel proteins and is an integral membrane protein that mediates
        the voltage-dependent potassium ion permeability of excitable membranes. Sev...

        in the central nervous system through activation of ligand-gated ion channels
        and G protein-coupled membrane receptors. The protein encoded by this gene
        forms functional heteromeric kainate-preferring ionic channels with the subunits
        encoded by related gene famil...


        KCNJ3: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they
        participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded
        by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium
        channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium
        to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins
        and plays an important role in regulating heartbeat. It associates with three
        other G-protein-activated potassium channels to form a heteromultimeric pore-forming
        complex that also couples to neurotransmitter receptors in the brain and whereby
        channel activation can inhibit action potential firing by hyperpolarizing
        the plasma membrane. These multimeric G-protein-gated inwardly-rectifying
        potassium (GIRK) channels may play a role in the path...


        GABRB1: The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor is a multisubunit chloride
        channel that mediates the fastest inhibitory synaptic transmission in the
        central nervous system. This gene encodes GABA A receptor, beta 1 subunit.
        It is mapped to chromosome 4p12 in a cluster comprised of genes encoding alpha
        4, alpha 2 and gamma 1 subunits of the GABA A receptor. Alteration of ...


        SCN10A: The protein encoded by this gene is a tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated
        sodium channel alpha subunit. The properties of the channel formed by the
        encoded transmembrane protein can be altered by interaction with different
        beta subunits. This protein may be involved in the onset of pain associated
        with peripheral neuropathy. Alternat...


        KCNJ9: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they
        participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded

        channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium
        to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins.
        It associates with another G-protein-act...


        SCN1A: Voltage-dependent sodium channels are heteromeric complexes that regulate
        sodium exchange between intracellular and extracellular spaces and are essential
        for the generation and propagation of action potentials in muscle cells and
        neurons. Each sodium channel is composed of a large pore-forming, glycosylated
        alpha subunit and two smaller beta subunits. This gene encodes a sodium channel
        alpha subunit, which has four homologous domains, each of which contains six
        transmembrane regions. Allelic variants of this gene are associated with generalized
        epilepsy with febrile seizures and epileptic encephalopathy. Alternative splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants. The RefSeq Project has decided to
        create four representative RefSeq records. Three of the transcript variants
        are supported by experime...


        GABRA5: GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain
        where it acts at GABA-A receptors, which are ligand-gated chloride channels.
        Chloride conductance of these channels can be modulated by agents such as
        benzodiazepines that bind to the GABA-A receptor. At least 16 distinct subunits
        of GABA-A receptors have been identified. Transcript variants utilizing three
        d...


        GRIN2B: This gene encodes a member of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
        family within the ionotropic glutamate receptor superfamily. The encoded protein
        is a subunit of the NMDA receptor ion channel which acts as an agonist binding
        site for glutamate. The NMDA receptors mediate a slow calcium-permeable component
        of excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The NMDA
        receptors are heterotetramers of seven genetically encoded, differentially
        expressed subunits including NR1 (GRIN1), NR2 (GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, or
        GRIN2D) and NR3 (GRIN3A or GRIN3B). The early expression of this gene in development
        suggests a role in brain development, circuit formation, synaptic plasticity,
        and cellular migration and differentiation. Naturally occurring mutations
        within ...


        KCNC2: The Shaker gene family of Drosophila encodes components of voltage-gated
        potassium channels and is comprised of four subfamilies. Based on sequence
        similarity, this gene is similar to one of these subfamilies, namely the Shaw
        subfamily. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the delayed rectifier
        class of channel proteins and is an integral membrane protein that mediates
        the voltage-dependent potassium ion permeability of excitable membranes. Sev...

        Here are the gene summaries:



        GRIA4: Glutamate receptors are the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter
        receptors in the mammalian brain and are activated in a variety of normal
        neurophysiologic processes. These receptors are heteromeric protein complexes
        composed of multiple subunits, arranged to form ligand-gated ion channels.
        The classification of glutamate receptors is based on their activation by
        different pharmacologic agonists. The subunit encoded by this gene belongs
        to a family of AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate)-sensitive
        glutamate receptors, and is subject to RNA editing (AGA->GGA; R->G). Alternative
        splicing of this gene results in transcript variants encoding different i...


        GLRA1: The protein encoded by this gene is a subunit of a pentameric inhibitory
        glycine receptor, which mediates postsynaptic inhibition in the central nervous
        system. Defects in this gene are a cause of startle disease (STHE), also known
        as hereditary hyperekplexia or congenital stiff-person syndrome. Multiple
        transcript var...


        GABBR1: This gene encodes a receptor for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which
        is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system.
        This receptor functions as a heterodimer with GABA(B) receptor 2. Defects
        in this gene may underlie brain disorders such as schizophrenia and epilepsy.
        Alternative splicing generates multiple transcript variants, but the full-...


        GRIA1: Glutamate receptors are the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter
        receptors in the mammalian brain and are activated in a variety of normal
        neurophysiologic processes. These receptors are heteromeric protein complexes
        with multiple subunits, each possessing transmembrane regions, and all arranged
        to form a ligand-gated ion channel. The classification of glutamate receptors
        is based on their activation by different pharmacologic agonists. This gene
        belongs to a family of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate
        (AMPA) recept...


        KCNA2: Potassium channels represent the most complex class of voltage-gated
        ion channels from both functional and structural standpoints. Their diverse
        functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin
        secretion, neuronal excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth

        other G-protein-activated potassium channels to form a heteromultimeric pore-forming
        complex that also couples to neurotransmitter receptors in the brain and whereby
        channel activation can inhibit action potential firing by hyperpolarizing

        SCN1A: Voltage-dependent sodium channels are heteromeric complexes that regulate
        sodium exchange between intracellular and extracellular spaces and are essential
        for the generation and propagation of action potentials in muscle cells and
        neurons. Each sodium channel is composed of a large pore-forming, glycosylated
        alpha subunit and two smaller beta subunits. This gene encodes a sodium channel
        alpha subunit, which has four homologous domains, each of which contains six
        transmembrane regions. Allelic variants of this gene are associated with generalized
        epilepsy with febrile seizures and epileptic encephalopathy. Alternative splicing

        family within the ionotropic glutamate receptor superfamily. The encoded protein
        is a subunit of the NMDA receptor ion channel which acts as an agonist binding
        site for glutamate. The NMDA receptors mediate a slow calcium-permeable component
        of excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The NMDA

        expressed subunits including NR1 (GRIN1), NR2 (GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, or
        GRIN2D) and NR3 (GRIN3A or GRIN3B). The early expression of this gene in development

        in the central nervous system through activation of ligand-gated ion channels
        and G protein-coupled membrane receptors. The protein encoded by this gene
        forms functional heteromeric kainate-preferring ionic channels with the subunits
        encoded by related gene famil...


        KCNJ3: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they
        participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded
        by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium
        channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium
        to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins
        and plays an important role in regulating heartbeat. It associates with three
        other G-protein-activated potassium channels to form a heteromultimeric pore-forming
        complex that also couples to neurotransmitter receptors in the brain and whereby
        channel activation can inhibit action potential firing by hyperpolarizing
        the plasma membrane. These multimeric G-protein-gated inwardly-rectifying
        potassium (GIRK) channels may play a role in the path...


        GABRB1: The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor is a multisubunit chloride
        channel that mediates the fastest inhibitory synaptic transmission in the
        central nervous system. This gene encodes GABA A receptor, beta 1 subunit.
        It is mapped to chromosome 4p12 in a cluster comprised of genes encoding alpha
        4, alpha 2 and gamma 1 subunits of the GABA A receptor. Alteration of ...


        SCN10A: The protein encoded by this gene is a tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated
        sodium channel alpha subunit. The properties of the channel formed by the
        encoded transmembrane protein can be altered by interaction with different
        beta subunits. This protein may be involved in the onset of pain associated
        with peripheral neuropathy. Alternat...


        KCNJ9: Potassium channels are present in most mammalian cells, where they
        participate in a wide range of physiologic responses. The protein encoded
        by this gene is an integral membrane protein and inward-rectifier type potassium
        channel. The encoded protein, which has a greater tendency to allow potassium
        to flow into a cell rather than out of a cell, is controlled by G-proteins.
        It associates with another G-protein-act...


        SCN1A: Voltage-dependent sodium channels are heteromeric complexes that regulate
        sodium exchange between intracellular and extracellular spaces and are essential
        for the generation and propagation of action potentials in muscle cells and
        neurons. Each sodium channel is composed of a large pore-forming, glycosylated
        alpha subunit and two smaller beta subunits. This gene encodes a sodium channel
        alpha subunit, which has four homologous domains, each of which contains six
        transmembrane regions. Allelic variants of this gene are associated with generalized
        epilepsy with febrile seizures and epileptic encephalopathy. Alternative splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants. The RefSeq Project has decided to
        create four representative RefSeq records. Three of the transcript variants
        are supported by experime...


        GABRA5: GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain
        where it acts at GABA-A receptors, which are ligand-gated chloride channels.
        Chloride conductance of these channels can be modulated by agents such as
        benzodiazepines that bind to the GABA-A receptor. At least 16 distinct subunits
        of GABA-A receptors have been identified. Transcript variants utilizing three
        d...


        GRIN2B: This gene encodes a member of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
        family within the ionotropic glutamate receptor superfamily. The encoded protein
        is a subunit of the NMDA receptor ion channel which acts as an agonist binding
        site for glutamate. The NMDA receptors mediate a slow calcium-permeable component
        of excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The NMDA
        receptors are heterotetramers of seven genetically encoded, differentially
        expressed subunits including NR1 (GRIN1), NR2 (GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, or
        GRIN2D) and NR3 (GRIN3A or GRIN3B). The early expression of this gene in development
        suggests a role in brain development, circuit formation, synaptic plasticity,
        and cellular migration and differentiation. Naturally occurring mutations
        within ...


        KCNC2: The Shaker gene family of Drosophila encodes components of voltage-gated
        potassium channels and is comprised of four subfamilies. Based on sequence
        similarity, this gene is similar to one of these subfamilies, namely the Shaw
        subfamily. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the delayed rectifier
        class of channel proteins and is an integral membrane protein that mediates
        the voltage-dependent potassium ion permeability of excitable membranes. Sev...
