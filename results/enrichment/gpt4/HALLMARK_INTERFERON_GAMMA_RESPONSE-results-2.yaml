        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.


        Provide results in the format


        Summary: <high level summary>

        Mechanism: <mechanism>

        Enriched Terms: <term1>; <term2>; <term3>


        For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number
        the list.

        Always put the list of terms last, after mechanism, summary, or hypotheses.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Hypothesis: The genes in the list are primarily involved in regulating the
        immune response and cytokine signaling pathways. This suggests that they play
        a key role in the body''s ability to recognize and respond to pathogens and
        other foreign invaders. Dysfunction of these genes may therefore lead to an

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Summary and enriched terms:'
      response_text: '

        The genes in the list encode proteins involved in a variety of processes including
        immunity, inflammation, transcription, signal transduction, and protein folding
        and assembly. These processes are typically carried out by two main classes
        of molecules; ubiquitin ligases and cytokines. The genes in this list are
        enriched for terms including "signal transduction", "ubiquitin ligases", "immune
        modulation", "cytokine activity", "transcription regulation", "proteasome
        activity", "RNA binding", and "metallothionein".


        Mechanism:

        The genes in this list encode proteins involved in a variety of processes,
        with an emphasis on immunity and inflammation. These processes are typically
        mediated by ubiquitin ligases, cytokines, and other signal transduction proteins.
        Ubiquitin ligases mark target proteins for ubiquitination and other modifications,
        while cytokines affect the activity of multiple cells. Signal transduction
        proteins transmit signals across cell membranes, affecting the activity of
        cells. Metallothioneins play a role in detoxification and protein folding
        and assembly, while proteasomes carry out protein degradation within the cell.
        Transcripts are regulated by transcription factors, and many genes contain
        RNA binding domains. '

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Summary: This data set of genes is involved in a variety of biological processes
        related to immunity and development, especially transmembrane protein binding,
        signaling pathways, T cell regulation, epigenetic regulation, and regulation
        of transcription.
