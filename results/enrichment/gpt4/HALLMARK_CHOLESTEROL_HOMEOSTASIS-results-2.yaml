        ABCA2: The membrane-associated protein encoded by this gene is a member of
        the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport
        various molecules across extra- and intracellular membranes. ABC genes are
        divided into seven distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20,
        White). This protein is a member of the ABC1 subfamily. Members of the ABC1
        subfamily comprise the only major ABC subfamily found exclusively in multicellular
        eukaryotes. This protein is highly expressed in brain tissue and may play
        a role in macrophage lipid metab...

        of the contractile apparatus. The beta and gamma actins co-exist in most cell
        types as components of the cytoskeleton and as mediators of internal cell
        motility. Actin gamma 1, encoded by this gene, is a cytoplasmic actin found
        in all cell types. Mutations in this gene are associated with DFNA20/26, a

        protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane, is involved
        in endocytosis, and modulates mTOR signals, modifying ribosomal translation
        and mitochondrial function. The N-terminal region of the protein contains
        a polyglutamine tract of 14-31 residues that can be expanded in the pathogenic
        state to 32-200 residues. Intermediate length expansions of this tract increase
        susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, while long expansions of
        this tract result in spinocerebellar ataxia-2, an autosomal-dominantly inherited,
        neurodegenerative disorder. Genome-wide ...

        Studies of the similar gene in mice suggested a possible role of this protein
        in transcriptionally inactive haploid spermatids. Alternatively spliced ...


        CTNNB1: The protein encoded by this gene is part of a complex of proteins
        that constitute adherens junctions (AJs). AJs are necessary for the creation
        and maintenance of epithelial cell layers by regulating cell growth and adhesion
        between cells. The encoded protein also anchors the actin cytoskeleton and
        may be responsible for transmitting the contact inhibition signal that causes
        cells to stop dividing once the epithelial sheet is complete. Finally, this
        protein binds to the product of the APC gene, which is mutated in adenomatous
        polyposis of the colon. Mutations in this gene are a cause of colorectal cancer
        (CRC), p...

        phenylalkylamine Ca2+ antagonist [3H]emopamil and the photoaffinity label
        [3H]azidopamil. It is similar to sigma receptors and may be a member of a
        superfamily of high affinity drug-binding proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum
        of different tissues. This protein shares structural features with bacterial
        and eukaryontic drug transporting proteins. It has four putative transmembrane
        segments and contains two conserved glutamate residues which may be involved
        in the transport of cationic amphiphilics. Another prominent feature of this
        protein is its high content of aromatic amino acid residues (>23%) in its
        transmembrane segments. These aromatic amino acid residues have been...

        gene product shows high sequence similarity to enoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) hydratases
        of several species, particularly within a conserved domain characteristic
        of these proteins. The encoded protein, which contains a C-terminal peroxisomal
        targeting sequence, localizes to the peroxisome. The rat ortholog, which localizes
        to the matrix of both the peroxisome and mitochondria, can isomerize 3-trans,5-cis-dienoyl-CoA
        to 2-trans,4-trans-dienoyl-CoA, indicating that it is a delta3,5-delta2,4-dienoyl-CoA
        isomerase. This enzyme functions in the a...


        ERRFI1: ERRFI1 is a cytoplasmic protein whose expression is upregulated with

        in this gene are associated with type 2 ...


        FADS2: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fatty acid desaturase
        (FADS) gene family. Desaturase enzymes regulate unsaturation of fatty acids
        through the introduction of double bonds between defined carbons of the fatty
        acyl chain. FADS family members are considered fusion products composed of
        an N-terminal cytochrome b5-like domain and a C-terminal multiple membrane-spanning
        desaturase portion, both of which are characterized by conserved histidine
        motifs. This gene is clustered with family members at 11q12-q13.1; this cluster
        is thought to have arisen evolutionarily from gene duplication based on its...

        FBXO6: This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family which is characterized
        by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F-box. The F-box proteins constitute
        one of the four subunits of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs
        (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination.
        The F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains,
        Fbls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different
        protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein

        FDPS: This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the production of geranyl
        pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate from isopentenyl pyrophosphate and
        dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. The resulting product, farnesyl pyrophosphate,
        is a key intermediate in cholesterol and sterol biosynthesis, a substrate
        for protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation, and a ligand or agonist
        for certain hormone receptors and growth receptors. Drugs that inhibit this
        enzyme prevent the post-translational modifications of small GTPases and have
        been used to treat diseases related to bone resorption. Multiple pseudogenes
        have been found o...

        GSTM2: Cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of glutathione S-transferase are
        encoded by two distinct supergene families. At present, eight distinct classes
        of the soluble cytoplasmic mammalian glutathione S-transferases have been
        identified: alpha, kappa, mu, omega, pi, sigma, theta and zeta. This gene
        encodes a glutathione S-transferase that belongs to the mu class. The mu class
        of enzymes functions in the detoxification of electrophilic compounds, including
        carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative
        stress, by conjugation with glutathione. The genes encoding the mu class of
        enzymes are organized in a gene cluster on chromosome 1p13.3 and are known
        to be highly polymorphic. These...

        HMGCR: HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis
        and is regulated via a negative feedback mechanism mediated by sterols and
        non-sterol metabolites derived from mevalonate, the product of the reaction
        catalyzed by reductase. Normally in mammalian cells this enzyme is suppressed
        by cholesterol derived from the internalization and degradation of low density
        lipoprotein (LDL) via the LDL receptor. Competitive inhibitors of the reductase
        induce the expression of LDL receptors in the liver, which in turn increases
        the catabolism of plasma LDL and lowers the plasma concentration of cholesterol,
        an important dete...

        LDLR: The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family consists of
        cell surface proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific
        ligands. The encoded protein is normally bound at the cell membrane, where
        it binds low density lipoprotein/cholesterol and is taken into the cell. Lysosomes
        release the cholesterol, which is made available for repression of microsomal
        enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting
        step in cholesterol synthesis. At the same time, a reciprocal stimulation
        of cholesterol ester synthesis takes place. Mutations in this gene cause ...

        repeat domain and a single C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain. This
        protein can self-associate through the N-terminal domain allowing it to bind
        to multivalent saccharide ligands. This protein localizes to the extracellular
        matrix, the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This protein plays a role in numerous
        cellular functions including apoptosis, innate immunity, cell adhesion and
        T-cell regulation. Th...


        LGMN: This gene encodes a cysteine protease that has a strict specificity
        for hydrolysis of asparaginyl bonds. This enzyme may be involved in the processing
        of bacterial peptides and endogenous proteins for MHC class II presentation
        in the lysosomal/endosomal systems. Enzyme activation is triggered by acidic
        pH and appears to be autocatalytic. Protein expression occurs after monocytes
        differentiate into dendritic cells. A fully mature, active enzyme is produced
        following lipopolysaccharide expression in mature dendritic cells. Overexpression
        of this gene may be associated with the majority of solid tumor types. This
        gene has a pseudogene on chromosome 13. Several alternatively spliced tra...

        MVK: This gene encodes the peroxisomal enzyme mevalonate kinase. Mevalonate
        is a key intermediate, and mevalonate kinase a key early enzyme, in isoprenoid
        and sterol synthesis. Mevalonate kinase deficiency caused by mutation of this
        gene results in mevalonic aciduria, a disease characterized psychomotor retardation,
        failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia and recurrent febrile crises.

        PDK3: The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
        multienzyme complex that catalyzes the overall conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA
        and CO(2). It provides the primary link between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic
        acid (TCA) cycle, and thus is one of the major enzymes responsible for the

        of the E1 alpha subunit. This gene is predominantly expre...


        PLAUR: This gene encodes the receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator
        and, given its role in localizing and promoting plasmin formation, likely
        influences many normal and pathological processes related to cell-surface
        plasminogen activation and localized degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        It binds both the proprotein and mature forms of urokinase plasminogen activator
        and permits the activation of the receptor-bound pro-enzyme by plasmin. The
        protein lacks transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains and may be anchored to
        the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety following
        cleavage of the nascent polypeptide near its carboxy-terminus. However, a
        soluble protein is also produced in some cell types. Alternative splicing

        STARD4: Cholesterol homeostasis is regulated, at least in part, by sterol
        regulatory element (SRE)-binding proteins (e.g., SREBP1; MIM 184756) and by
        liver X receptors (e.g., LXRA; MIM 602423). Upon sterol depletion, LXRs are

        of cholesterol and unsaturated f...


        ACTG1: Actins are highly conserved proteins that are involved in various types
        of cell motility and in maintenance of the cytoskeleton. Three main groups
        of actin isoforms have been identified in vertebrate animals: alpha, beta,
        and gamma. The alpha actins are found in muscle tissues and are a major constituent
        of the contractile apparatus. The beta and gamma actins co-exist in most cell
        types as components of the cytoskeleton and as mediators of internal cell
        motility. Actin gamma 1, encoded by this gene, is a cytoplasmic actin found
        in all cell types. Mutations in this gene are associated with DFNA20/26, a
        subtype of autosomal dominant non-syndromic sensori...

        of this gene has not yet been determined; however, it is associated with the
        plasma membrane of undifferentiated, proliferating endothelial cells and differentiated
        villus enterocytes. Alternatively s...


        ANXA5: The Annexin 5 gene spans 29 kb containing 13 exons, and encodes a single
        transcript of approximately 1.6 kb and a protein product with a molecular
        weight of about 35 kDa.The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the annexin
        family of calcium-dependent phospholipid binding proteins some of which have
        been implicated in membrane-related events along exocytotic and endocytotic
        pathways. Annexin 5 is a phospholipase A2 and protein kinase C inhibitory
        protein with calcium channel activity and a potential role in cellular signal
        transduction, inflammation, growth and differentiation. Annexin 5 has also
        been described as placental anticoagulant protein I, vascular anticoagulant-alpha,
        endone...

        of cell cycle process; and regulation of transcription, DNA-templated. Loca...


        ATXN2: This gene belongs to a group of genes that is associated with microsatellite-expansion
        diseases, a class of neurological and neuromuscular disorders caused by expansion
        of short stretches of repetitive DNA. The protein encoded by this gene has
        two globular domains near the N-terminus, one of which contains a clathrin-mediated
        trans-Golgi signal and an endoplasmic reticulum exit signal. The encoded cytoplasmic
        protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane, is involved
        in endocytosis, and modulates mTOR signals, modifying ribosomal translation
        and mitochondrial function. The N-terminal region of the protein contains
        a polyglutamine tract of 14-31 residues that can be expanded in the pathogenic
        state to 32-200 residues. Intermediate length expansions of this tract increase
        susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, while long expansions of
        this tract result in spinocerebellar ataxia-2, an autosomal-dominantly inherited,
        neurodegenerative disorder. Genome-wide ...


        AVPR1A: The protein encoded by this gene acts as receptor for arginine vasopressin.
        This receptor belongs to the subfamily of G-protein coupled receptors which
        includes AVPR1B, V2R and OXT receptors. Its activity is mediated by G proteins
        which stimulate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. The
        receptor mediates cell contraction and proliferation, platelet ...


        CBS: The protein encoded by this gene acts as a homotetramer to catalyze the
        conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine, the first step in the transsulfuration
        pathway. The encoded protein is allosterically activated by adenosyl-methionine
        and uses pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor. Defects in this gene can cause
        cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency (CBSD), which can lead to homocystinuria.
        This gene is a major contributor to cellular hydrogen sulfide producti...


        CD9: This gene encodes a member of the transmembrane 4 superfamily, also known
        as the tetraspanin family. Tetraspanins are cell surface glycoproteins with
        four transmembrane domains that form multimeric complexes with other cell
        surface proteins. The encoded protein functions in many cellular processes
        including differentiation, adhesion, and signal transduction, and expression
        of this gene plays a cri...


        CHKA: The major pathway for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine occurs
        via the CDP-choline pathway. The protein encoded by this gene is the initial
        enzyme in the sequence and may play a regulatory role. The encoded protein
        also catalyzes the phosphorylation of ethanolamine. Two transcript variants
        encoding di...


        CLU: The protein encoded by this gene is a secreted chaperone that can under
        some stress conditions also be found in the cell cytosol. It has been suggested
        to be involved in several basic biological events such as cell death, tumor
        progression, and neurodegenerative disorders. Alternate splicing res...


        CPEB2: The protein encoded by this gene is highly similar to cytoplasmic polyadenylation
        element binding protein (CPEB), an mRNA-binding protein that regulates cytoplasmic
        polyadenylation of mRNA as a trans factor in oogenesis and spermatogenesis.
        Studies of the similar gene in mice suggested a possible role of this protein
        in transcriptionally inactive haploid spermatids. Alternatively spliced ...


        CTNNB1: The protein encoded by this gene is part of a complex of proteins
        that constitute adherens junctions (AJs). AJs are necessary for the creation
        and maintenance of epithelial cell layers by regulating cell growth and adhesion
        between cells. The encoded protein also anchors the actin cytoskeleton and
        may be responsible for transmitting the contact inhibition signal that causes
        cells to stop dividing once the epithelial sheet is complete. Finally, this
        protein binds to the product of the APC gene, which is mutated in adenomatous
        polyposis of the colon. Mutations in this gene are a cause of colorectal cancer
        (CRC), p...


        CXCL16: Enables chemokine activity. Involved in several processes, including
        positive regulation of cell growth; response to interferon-gamma; and response
        to tumor necrosis factor. Located in extracellular space. Biomarker of COVID-19
        and systemic scl...


        CYP51A1: This gene encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of
        enzymes. The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many
        reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids
        and other lipids. This endoplasmic reticulum protein participates in the synthesis
        of cholesterol by catalyzing the removal of the 14alpha-methyl group from
        lanosterol. Homologous genes are found in all three eukaryotic phyla, fungi,
        plants, and animals, suggesting that this is one of the oldest cytoc...


        DHCR7: This gene encodes an enzyme that removes the C(7-8) double bond in
        the B ring of sterols and catalyzes the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol
        to cholesterol. This gene is ubiquitously expressed and its transmembrane
        protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and nuclear outer
        membrane. Mutations in this gene cause Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS);
        a syndrome that is metabolically characterized by reduced serum cholesterol
        levels and elevated serum 7-dehydrocholesterol levels and phenotypically characterized
        by cognitive disability, facial dysmorphism, syndactyly of second and third
        toes, and holoprosencephaly in severe cases to minimal physical abnormali...


        EBP: The protein encoded by this gene is an integral membrane protein of the
        endoplasmic reticulum. It is a high affinity binding protein for the antiischemic
        phenylalkylamine Ca2+ antagonist [3H]emopamil and the photoaffinity label
        [3H]azidopamil. It is similar to sigma receptors and may be a member of a
        superfamily of high affinity drug-binding proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum
        of different tissues. This protein shares structural features with bacterial
        and eukaryontic drug transporting proteins. It has four putative transmembrane
        segments and contains two conserved glutamate residues which may be involved
        in the transport of cationic amphiphilics. Another prominent feature of this
        protein is its high content of aromatic amino acid residues (>23%) in its
        transmembrane segments. These aromatic amino acid residues have been...


        ECH1: This gene encodes a member of the hydratase/isomerase superfamily. The
        gene product shows high sequence similarity to enoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) hydratases
        of several species, particularly within a conserved domain characteristic
        of these proteins. The encoded protein, which contains a C-terminal peroxisomal
        targeting sequence, localizes to the peroxisome. The rat ortholog, which localizes
        to the matrix of both the peroxisome and mitochondria, can isomerize 3-trans,5-cis-dienoyl-CoA
        to 2-trans,4-trans-dienoyl-CoA, indicating that it is a delta3,5-delta2,4-dienoyl-CoA
        isomerase. This enzyme functions in the a...


        ERRFI1: ERRFI1 is a cytoplasmic protein whose expression is upregulated with
        cell growth (Wick et al., 1995 [PubMed 7641805]). It shares significant homology
        with the protein product of rat gene-33, which is induced during cell stress
        and mediates cell signaling (Makkinje et al., 2000 [PubMed 10749885...


        ETHE1: This gene encodes a member of the metallo beta-lactamase family of
        iron-containing proteins involved in the mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway.
        The encoded protein catalyzes the oxidation of a persulfide substrate to sulfite.
        Certain mutations in this gene cause ethylmalonic encephalopathy, an infantile
        metabolic disorder affecting the brain, gastrointestinal tract and peripheral
        vessels. Alternative spli...


        FABP5: This gene encodes the fatty acid binding protein found in epidermal
        cells, and was first identified as being upregulated in psoriasis tissue.
        Fatty acid binding proteins are a family of small, highly conserved, cytoplasmic
        proteins that bind long-chain fatty acids and other hydrophobic ligands. FABPs
        may play roles in fatty acid uptake, transport, and metabolism. Polymorphisms
        in this gene are associated with type 2 ...


        FADS2: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fatty acid desaturase
        (FADS) gene family. Desaturase enzymes regulate unsaturation of fatty acids
        through the introduction of double bonds between defined carbons of the fatty
        acyl chain. FADS family members are considered fusion products composed of
        an N-terminal cytochrome b5-like domain and a C-terminal multiple membrane-spanning
        desaturase portion, both of which are characterized by conserved histidine
        motifs. This gene is clustered with family members at 11q12-q13.1; this cluster
        is thought to have arisen evolutionarily from gene duplication based on its...


        FASN: The enzyme encoded by this gene is a multifunctional protein. Its main
        function is to catalyze the synthesis of palmitate from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA,
        in the presence of NADPH, into long-chain saturated fatty acids. In some cancer
        cell lines, this protein has been found to be fused with estrogen receptor-alpha
        (ER-alpha), in which the N-terminus ...


        FBXO6: This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family which is characterized
        by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F-box. The F-box proteins constitute
        one of the four subunits of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs
        (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination.
        The F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains,
        Fbls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different
        protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein
        encoded by this gene belongs to the Fbxs class, and its C-terminal ...

        FDPS: This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the production of geranyl
        pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate from isopentenyl pyrophosphate and
        dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. The resulting product, farnesyl pyrophosphate,
        is a key intermediate in cholesterol and sterol biosynthesis, a substrate
        for protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation, and a ligand or agonist
        for certain hormone receptors and growth receptors. Drugs that inhibit this
        enzyme prevent the post-translational modifications of small GTPases and have
        been used to treat diseases related to bone resorption. Multiple pseudogenes
        have been found o...


        GLDC: Degradation of glycine is brought about by the glycine cleavage system,
        which is composed of four mitochondrial protein components: P protein (a pyridoxal
        phosphate-dependent glycine decarboxylase), H protein (a lipoic acid-containing
        protein), T protein (a tetrahydrofolate-requiring enzyme), and L protein (a
        lipoamide dehydrogenase). The protein encoded by this gene is the P protein,
        which binds to glycine and enables the methylamine group from glycine to be
        transferre...


        GNAI1: Guanine nucleotide binding proteins are heterotrimeric signal-transducing
        molecules consisting of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. The alpha subunit
        binds guanine nucleotide, can hydrolyze GTP, and can interact with other proteins.
        The protein encoded by this gene represents the alpha subunit of an inhibitory
        complex. The encoded protein is part of a complex that responds to beta-adrenergic
        signals by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Two...

        GSTM2: Cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of glutathione S-transferase are
        encoded by two distinct supergene families. At present, eight distinct classes
        of the soluble cytoplasmic mammalian glutathione S-transferases have been
        identified: alpha, kappa, mu, omega, pi, sigma, theta and zeta. This gene
        encodes a glutathione S-transferase that belongs to the mu class. The mu class
        of enzymes functions in the detoxification of electrophilic compounds, including
        carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative
        stress, by conjugation with glutathione. The genes encoding the mu class of
        enzymes are organized in a gene cluster on chromosome 1p13.3 and are known
        to be highly polymorphic. These...


        GUSB: This gene encodes a hydrolase that degrades glycosaminoglycans, including
        heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin-4,6-sulfate. The enzyme
        forms a homotetramer that is localized to the lysosome. Mutations in this
        gene result in mucopolysaccharidosis type VII. Alternative splicing results
        in multiple transcript variants. There ...


        HMGCR: HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis
        and is regulated via a negative feedback mechanism mediated by sterols and
        non-sterol metabolites derived from mevalonate, the product of the reaction
        catalyzed by reductase. Normally in mammalian cells this enzyme is suppressed
        by cholesterol derived from the internalization and degradation of low density
        lipoprotein (LDL) via the LDL receptor. Competitive inhibitors of the reductase
        induce the expression of LDL receptors in the liver, which in turn increases
        the catabolism of plasma LDL and lowers the plasma concentration of cholesterol,
        an important dete...

        of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to its highly electrophilic isomer, dimethylallyl
        diphosphate (DMAPP), which are the substrates for the successive reaction
        that results in the synthesis of farnesyl diphosphate and, ultimately, cholesterol.  It
        has been shown in peroxisomal deficiency diseases such as Zellweger syndrome

        LDLR: The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family consists of
        cell surface proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific
        ligands. The encoded protein is normally bound at the cell membrane, where
        it binds low density lipoprotein/cholesterol and is taken into the cell. Lysosomes
        release the cholesterol, which is made available for repression of microsomal
        enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting
        step in cholesterol synthesis. At the same time, a reciprocal stimulation
        of cholesterol ester synthesis takes place. Mutations in this gene cause ...


        LGALS3: This gene encodes a member of the galectin family of carbohydrate
        binding proteins. Members of this protein family have an affinity for beta-galactosides.
        The encoded protein is characterized by an N-terminal proline-rich tandem
        repeat domain and a single C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain. This
        protein can self-associate through the N-terminal domain allowing it to bind
        to multivalent saccharide ligands. This protein localizes to the extracellular
        matrix, the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This protein plays a role in numerous
        cellular functions including apoptosis, innate immunity, cell adhesion and
        T-cell regulation. Th...


        LGMN: This gene encodes a cysteine protease that has a strict specificity
        for hydrolysis of asparaginyl bonds. This enzyme may be involved in the processing
        of bacterial peptides and endogenous proteins for MHC class II presentation
        in the lysosomal/endosomal systems. Enzyme activation is triggered by acidic
        pH and appears to be autocatalytic. Protein expression occurs after monocytes
        differentiate into dendritic cells. A fully mature, active enzyme is produced
        following lipopolysaccharide expression in mature dendritic cells. Overexpression
        of this gene may be associated with the majority of solid tumor types. This
        gene has a pseudogene on chromosome 13. Several alternatively spliced tra...


        LPL: LPL encodes lipoprotein lipase, which is expressed in heart, muscle,
        and adipose tissue. LPL functions as a homodimer, and has the dual functions
        of triglyceride hydrolase and ligand/bridging factor for receptor-mediated
        lipoprotein uptake. Severe mutations that cause LPL deficiency result in type
        I hyperlipoproteinemia, while less extreme mutations in L...


        LSS: The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the conversion of (S)-2,3
        oxidosqualene to lanosterol. The encoded protein is a member of the terpene

        of mevalonate pyrophosphate into isopentenyl pyrophosphate in one of the early
        steps in cholesterol biosynthesis. It decarboxylates and dehydrates its subst...


        MVK: This gene encodes the peroxisomal enzyme mevalonate kinase. Mevalonate
        is a key intermediate, and mevalonate kinase a key early enzyme, in isoprenoid
        and sterol synthesis. Mevalonate kinase deficiency caused by mutation of this
        gene results in mevalonic aciduria, a disease characterized psychomotor retardation,
        failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia and recurrent febrile crises.
        Defects in this gene also cause hyperimmunoglobulinaemia D and periodic fever
        syndrome, a disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of fever associated
        with lymphadenopathy, a...


        NFIL3: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional regulator that
        binds as a homodimer to activating transcription factor (ATF) sites in many
        cellular and viral promoters. The encoded protein represses PER1 and PER2
        expression and therefore plays a role in the regulation of circadian rhythm.
        Three transcript variants encod...


        NIBAN1: This gene encodes a member of the family with sequence similarity
        129 protein family. This gene is highly expressed in several cancer cells

        PDK3: The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
        multienzyme complex that catalyzes the overall conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA
        and CO(2). It provides the primary link between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic
        acid (TCA) cycle, and thus is one of the major enzymes responsible for the
        regulation of glucose metabolism. The enzymatic activity of PDH is regulated
        by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle, and phosphorylation results
        in inactivation of PDH. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the three
        pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases that inhibits the PDH complex by phosphorylation
        of the E1 alpha subunit. This gene is predominantly expre...


        PLAUR: This gene encodes the receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator
        and, given its role in localizing and promoting plasmin formation, likely
        influences many normal and pathological processes related to cell-surface
        plasminogen activation and localized degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        It binds both the proprotein and mature forms of urokinase plasminogen activator
        and permits the activation of the receptor-bound pro-enzyme by plasmin. The
        protein lacks transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains and may be anchored to
        the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety following
        cleavage of the nascent polypeptide near its carboxy-terminus. However, a
        soluble protein is also produced in some cell types. Alternative splicing
        results in multipl...


        PLSCR1: This gene encodes a phospholipid scramblase family member. The encoded
        protein is involved in disruption of the asymmetrical distribution of phospholipids
        between the inner and outer leaflets of the plasma membrane, resulting in
        externalization of phosphatidylserine. This cell membrane disruption plays
        an important role in the blood coagulation cascade as well as macrophage clearing
        of apoptotic cells. The encoded protein has additionall...


        PMVK: This gene encodes a peroxisomal enzyme that is a member of the galactokinase,
        homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase, and phosphomevalonate kinase (GHMP)
        family of ATP-dependent enzymes. The encoded protein catalyzes the conversion
        of mevalonate 5-phosphate to mevalonate 5-diphosphate, which is the fifth
        step in the mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. Mutations in this
        gene are linked to certain types of porokeratosis including disseminated supe...

        Re...


        PPARG: This gene encodes a member of the peroxisome proliferator-activated
        receptor (PPAR) subfamily of nuclear receptors. PPARs form heterodimers with
        retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and these heterodimers regulate transcription
        of various genes. Three subtypes of PPARs are known: PPAR-alpha, PPAR-delta,
        and PPAR-gamma. The protein encoded by this gene is PPAR-gamma and is a regulator
        of adipocyte differentiation. Additionally, PPAR-gamma has been implicated
        in the pathology of numerous diseases including obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis
        a...


        S100A11: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the S100 family of
        proteins containing 2 EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. S100 proteins are localized

        and is thought to be one of the rate-limiting enzymes in this pat...


        SREBF2: This gene encodes a member of the a ubiquitously expressed transcription
        factor that controls cholesterol homeostasis by regulating transcription of
        sterol-regulated genes. The encoded protein contains a basic helix-loop-helix-leucine
        zipper (bHLH-Zip) domain and binds the sterol regulatory element 1 motif.
        Alternate ...


        STARD4: Cholesterol homeostasis is regulated, at least in part, by sterol
        regulatory element (SRE)-binding proteins (e.g., SREBP1; MIM 184756) and by
        liver X receptors (e.g., LXRA; MIM 602423). Upon sterol depletion, LXRs are
        inactive and SREBPs are cleaved, after which they bind promoter SREs and activate
        genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake. Sterol transport is
        mediated by vesicles or by soluble protein carriers, such as steroidogenic
        acute regulatory protein (STAR; MIM 600617). STAR is homologous to a family
        of proteins containing a 200- to 210...

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.


        Provide results in the format


        Summary: <high level summary>

        Mechanism: <mechanism>

        Enriched Terms: <term1>; <term2>; <term3>


        For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number
        the list.

        Always put the list of terms last, after mechanism, summary, or hypotheses.

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.


        Provide results in the format


        Summary: <high level summary>

        Mechanism: <mechanism>

        Enriched Terms: <term1>; <term2>; <term3>


        For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number
        the list.

        Always put the list of terms last, after mechanism, summary, or hypotheses.

        NFIL3: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional regulator that
        binds as a homodimer to activating transcription factor (ATF) sites in many
        cellular and viral promoters. The encoded protein represses PER1 and PER2
        expression and therefore plays a role in the regulation of circadian rhythm.
        Three transcript variants encod...


        LGMN: This gene encodes a cysteine protease that has a strict specificity
        for hydrolysis of asparaginyl bonds. This enzyme may be involved in the processing
        of bacterial peptides and endogenous proteins for MHC class II presentation
        in the lysosomal/endosomal systems. Enzyme activation is triggered by acidic
        pH and appears to be autocatalytic. Protein expression occurs after monocytes
        differentiate into dendritic cells. A fully mature, active enzyme is produced
        following lipopolysaccharide expression in mature dendritic cells. Overexpression
        of this gene may be associated with the majority of solid tumor types. This
        gene has a pseudogene on chromosome 13. Several alternatively spliced tra...


        PLSCR1: This gene encodes a phospholipid scramblase family member. The encoded
        protein is involved in disruption of the asymmetrical distribution of phospholipids
        between the inner and outer leaflets of the plasma membrane, resulting in
        externalization of phosphatidylserine. This cell membrane disruption plays
        an important role in the blood coagulation cascade as well as macrophage clearing
        of apoptotic cells. The encoded protein has additionall...


        FDPS: This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the production of geranyl
        pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate from isopentenyl pyrophosphate and
        dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. The resulting product, farnesyl pyrophosphate,
        is a key intermediate in cholesterol and sterol biosynthesis, a substrate
        for protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation, and a ligand or agonist
        for certain hormone receptors and growth receptors. Drugs that inhibit this
        enzyme prevent the post-translational modifications of small GTPases and have
        been used to treat diseases related to bone resorption. Multiple pseudogenes
        have been found o...


        DHCR7: This gene encodes an enzyme that removes the C(7-8) double bond in
        the B ring of sterols and catalyzes the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol
        to cholesterol. This gene is ubiquitously expressed and its transmembrane
        protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and nuclear outer
        membrane. Mutations in this gene cause Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS);
        a syndrome that is metabolically characterized by reduced serum cholesterol
        levels and elevated serum 7-dehydrocholesterol levels and phenotypically characterized
        by cognitive disability, facial dysmorphism, syndactyly of second and third
        toes, and holoprosencephaly in severe cases to minimal physical abnormali...


        ACTG1: Actins are highly conserved proteins that are involved in various types
        of cell motility and in maintenance of the cytoskeleton. Three main groups
        of actin isoforms have been identified in vertebrate animals: alpha, beta,
        and gamma. The alpha actins are found in muscle tissues and are a major constituent
        of the contractile apparatus. The beta and gamma actins co-exist in most cell
        types as components of the cytoskeleton and as mediators of internal cell
        motility. Actin gamma 1, encoded by this gene, is a cytoplasmic actin found
        in all cell types. Mutations in this gene are associated with DFNA20/26, a
        subtype of autosomal dominant non-syndromic sensori...


        PLAUR: This gene encodes the receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator
        and, given its role in localizing and promoting plasmin formation, likely
        influences many normal and pathological processes related to cell-surface
        plasminogen activation and localized degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        It binds both the proprotein and mature forms of urokinase plasminogen activator
        and permits the activation of the receptor-bound pro-enzyme by plasmin. The
        protein lacks transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains and may be anchored to
        the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety following
        cleavage of the nascent polypeptide near its carboxy-terminus. However, a
        soluble protein is also produced in some cell types. Alternative splicing
        results in multipl...


        LPL: LPL encodes lipoprotein lipase, which is expressed in heart, muscle,
        and adipose tissue. LPL functions as a homodimer, and has the dual functions
        of triglyceride hydrolase and ligand/bridging factor for receptor-mediated
        lipoprotein uptake. Severe mutations that cause LPL deficiency result in type
        I hyperlipoproteinemia, while less extreme mutations in L...


        SEMA3B: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the class-3 semaphorin/collapsin
        family, whose members function in growth cone guidance during neuronal development.
        This family member inhibits axonal extension and has been shown to act as
        a tumor suppressor by inducing apoptosis. Alternative splicing of this...


        ADH4: This gene encodes class II alcohol dehydrogenase 4 pi subunit, which
        is a member of the alcohol dehydrogenase family. Members of this enzyme family
        metabolize a wide variety of substrates, including ethanol, retinol, other
        aliphatic alcohols, hydroxysteroids, and lipid peroxidation products. Class
        II alcohol dehydrogenase is a homodimer composed of 2 pi subunits. It exhibits
        a high activity for oxidation of long-chain aliphatic alcohols and aromatic
        alcohols and is less sensitive to pyr...


        ECH1: This gene encodes a member of the hydratase/isomerase superfamily. The
        gene product shows high sequence similarity to enoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) hydratases
        of several species, particularly within a conserved domain characteristic
        of these proteins. The encoded protein, which contains a C-terminal peroxisomal
        targeting sequence, localizes to the peroxisome. The rat ortholog, which localizes
        to the matrix of both the peroxisome and mitochondria, can isomerize 3-trans,5-cis-dienoyl-CoA
        to 2-trans,4-trans-dienoyl-CoA, indicating that it is a delta3,5-delta2,4-dienoyl-CoA
        isomerase. This enzyme functions in the a...


        GNAI1: Guanine nucleotide binding proteins are heterotrimeric signal-transducing
        molecules consisting of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. The alpha subunit
        binds guanine nucleotide, can hydrolyze GTP, and can interact with other proteins.
        The protein encoded by this gene represents the alpha subunit of an inhibitory
        complex. The encoded protein is part of a complex that responds to beta-adrenergic
        signals by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Two...

        steps in cholesterol biosynthesis. It decarboxylates and dehydrates its subst...


        CHKA: The major pathway for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine occurs
        via the CDP-choline pathway. The protein encoded by this gene is the initial
        enzyme in the sequence and may play a regulatory role. The encoded protein
        also catalyzes the phosphorylation of ethanolamine. Two transcript variants
        encoding di...


        IDI1: IDI1 encodes a peroxisomally-localized enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion
        of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to its highly electrophilic isomer, dimethylallyl
        diphosphate (DMAPP), which are the substrates for the successive reaction
        that results in the synthesis of farnesyl diphosphate and, ultimately, cholesterol.  It
        has been shown in peroxisomal deficiency diseases such as Zellweger syndrome
        and neonata...


        ATXN2: This gene belongs to a group of genes that is associated with microsatellite-expansion
        diseases, a class of neurological and neuromuscular disorders caused by expansion
        of short stretches of repetitive DNA. The protein encoded by this gene has
        two globular domains near the N-terminus, one of which contains a clathrin-mediated
        trans-Golgi signal and an endoplasmic reticulum exit signal. The encoded cytoplasmic
        protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane, is involved
        in endocytosis, and modulates mTOR signals, modifying ribosomal translation
        and mitochondrial function. The N-terminal region of the protein contains
        a polyglutamine tract of 14-31 residues that can be expanded in the pathogenic
        state to 32-200 residues. Intermediate length expansions of this tract increase
        susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, while long expansions of
        this tract result in spinocerebellar ataxia-2, an autosomal-dominantly inherited,
        neurodegenerative disorder. Genome-wide ...


        MAL2: This gene encodes a multispan transmembrane protein belonging to the
        MAL proteolipid family. The protein is a component of lipid rafts and, in
        polarized cells, it primarily localizes to endosomal structures beneath the
        apical membrane. It is required for transcytosis, an intracellular transport
        pathway used to deliver membrane-bound proteins and exo...


        CYP51A1: This gene encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of
        enzymes. The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many
        reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids
        and other lipids. This endoplasmic reticulum protein participates in the synthesis
        of cholesterol by catalyzing the removal of the 14alpha-methyl group from
        lanosterol. Homologous genes are found in all three eukaryotic phyla, fungi,
        plants, and animals, suggesting that this is one of the oldest cytoc...

        a role in macrophage lipid metab...


        LDLR: The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family consists of
        cell surface proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific
        ligands. The encoded protein is normally bound at the cell membrane, where
        it binds low density lipoprotein/cholesterol and is taken into the cell. Lysosomes
        release the cholesterol, which is made available for repression of microsomal
        enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting
        step in cholesterol synthesis. At the same time, a reciprocal stimulation
        of cholesterol ester synthesis takes place. Mutations in this gene cause ...

        phenylalkylamine Ca2+ antagonist [3H]emopamil and the photoaffinity label
        [3H]azidopamil. It is similar to sigma receptors and may be a member of a
        superfamily of high affinity drug-binding proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum
        of different tissues. This protein shares structural features with bacterial
        and eukaryontic drug transporting proteins. It has four putative transmembrane
        segments and contains two conserved glutamate residues which may be involved
        in the transport of cationic amphiphilics. Another prominent feature of this
        protein is its high content of aromatic amino acid residues (>23%) in its
        transmembrane segments. These aromatic amino acid residues have been...


        FABP5: This gene encodes the fatty acid binding protein found in epidermal
        cells, and was first identified as being upregulated in psoriasis tissue.

        FBXO6: This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family which is characterized
        by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F-box. The F-box proteins constitute
        one of the four subunits of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs
        (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination.
        The F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains,
        Fbls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different
        protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein
        encoded by this gene belongs to the Fbxs class, and its C-terminal ...

        and is involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. Mutations in this gene are associated
        with CHILD syndrome, which is a X-linked dominant disorder of lipid metabolism
        with disturbed cholesterol biosynthesis, and typically lethal in males. Alternatively
        spliced transcript varia...


        STARD4: Cholesterol homeostasis is regulated, at least in part, by sterol
        regulatory element (SRE)-binding proteins (e.g., SREBP1; MIM 184756) and by
        liver X receptors (e.g., LXRA; MIM 602423). Upon sterol depletion, LXRs are
        inactive and SREBPs are cleaved, after which they bind promoter SREs and activate
        genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake. Sterol transport is
        mediated by vesicles or by soluble protein carriers, such as steroidogenic
        acute regulatory protein (STAR; MIM 600617). STAR is homologous to a family
        of proteins containing a 200- to 210...

        vessels. Alternative spli...


        GSTM2: Cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of glutathione S-transferase are
        encoded by two distinct supergene families. At present, eight distinct classes
        of the soluble cytoplasmic mammalian glutathione S-transferases have been
        identified: alpha, kappa, mu, omega, pi, sigma, theta and zeta. This gene
        encodes a glutathione S-transferase that belongs to the mu class. The mu class
        of enzymes functions in the detoxification of electrophilic compounds, including
        carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative
        stress, by conjugation with glutathione. The genes encoding the mu class of

        NFIL3: The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional regulator that
        binds as a homodimer to activating transcription factor (ATF) sites in many
        cellular and viral promoters. The encoded protein represses PER1 and PER2
        expression and therefore plays a role in the regulation of circadian rhythm.
        Three transcript variants encod...


        LGMN: This gene encodes a cysteine protease that has a strict specificity
        for hydrolysis of asparaginyl bonds. This enzyme may be involved in the processing
        of bacterial peptides and endogenous proteins for MHC class II presentation
        in the lysosomal/endosomal systems. Enzyme activation is triggered by acidic
        pH and appears to be autocatalytic. Protein expression occurs after monocytes
        differentiate into dendritic cells. A fully mature, active enzyme is produced
        following lipopolysaccharide expression in mature dendritic cells. Overexpression
        of this gene may be associated with the majority of solid tumor types. This
        gene has a pseudogene on chromosome 13. Several alternatively spliced tra...


        PLSCR1: This gene encodes a phospholipid scramblase family member. The encoded
        protein is involved in disruption of the asymmetrical distribution of phospholipids
        between the inner and outer leaflets of the plasma membrane, resulting in
        externalization of phosphatidylserine. This cell membrane disruption plays
        an important role in the blood coagulation cascade as well as macrophage clearing
        of apoptotic cells. The encoded protein has additionall...


        FDPS: This gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the production of geranyl
        pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate from isopentenyl pyrophosphate and
        dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. The resulting product, farnesyl pyrophosphate,
        is a key intermediate in cholesterol and sterol biosynthesis, a substrate
        for protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation, and a ligand or agonist
        for certain hormone receptors and growth receptors. Drugs that inhibit this
        enzyme prevent the post-translational modifications of small GTPases and have
        been used to treat diseases related to bone resorption. Multiple pseudogenes
        have been found o...


        DHCR7: This gene encodes an enzyme that removes the C(7-8) double bond in
        the B ring of sterols and catalyzes the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol
        to cholesterol. This gene is ubiquitously expressed and its transmembrane
        protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and nuclear outer
        membrane. Mutations in this gene cause Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS);
        a syndrome that is metabolically characterized by reduced serum cholesterol
        levels and elevated serum 7-dehydrocholesterol levels and phenotypically characterized
        by cognitive disability, facial dysmorphism, syndactyly of second and third
        toes, and holoprosencephaly in severe cases to minimal physical abnormali...


        ACTG1: Actins are highly conserved proteins that are involved in various types
        of cell motility and in maintenance of the cytoskeleton. Three main groups
        of actin isoforms have been identified in vertebrate animals: alpha, beta,
        and gamma. The alpha actins are found in muscle tissues and are a major constituent
        of the contractile apparatus. The beta and gamma actins co-exist in most cell
        types as components of the cytoskeleton and as mediators of internal cell
        motility. Actin gamma 1, encoded by this gene, is a cytoplasmic actin found
        in all cell types. Mutations in this gene are associated with DFNA20/26, a
        subtype of autosomal dominant non-syndromic sensori...


        PLAUR: This gene encodes the receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator
        and, given its role in localizing and promoting plasmin formation, likely
        influences many normal and pathological processes related to cell-surface
        plasminogen activation and localized degradation of the extracellular matrix.
        It binds both the proprotein and mature forms of urokinase plasminogen activator
        and permits the activation of the receptor-bound pro-enzyme by plasmin. The
        protein lacks transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains and may be anchored to
        the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety following
        cleavage of the nascent polypeptide near its carboxy-terminus. However, a
        soluble protein is also produced in some cell types. Alternative splicing
        results in multipl...

        and adipose tissue. LPL functions as a homodimer, and has the dual functions
        of triglyceride hydrolase and ligand/bridging factor for receptor-mediated
        lipoprotein uptake. Severe mutations that cause LPL deficiency result in type
        I hyperlipoproteinemia, while less extreme mutations in L...

        gene product shows high sequence similarity to enoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) hydratases
        of several species, particularly within a conserved domain characteristic
        of these proteins. The encoded protein, which contains a C-terminal peroxisomal
        targeting sequence, localizes to the peroxisome. The rat ortholog, which localizes
        to the matrix of both the peroxisome and mitochondria, can isomerize 3-trans,5-cis-dienoyl-CoA
        to 2-trans,4-trans-dienoyl-CoA, indicating that it is a delta3,5-delta2,4-dienoyl-CoA
        isomerase. This enzyme functions in the a...


        GNAI1: Guanine nucleotide binding proteins are heterotrimeric signal-transducing
        molecules consisting of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. The alpha subunit

        of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to its highly electrophilic isomer, dimethylallyl
        diphosphate (DMAPP), which are the substrates for the successive reaction
        that results in the synthesis of farnesyl diphosphate and, ultimately, cholesterol.  It
        has been shown in peroxisomal deficiency diseases such as Zellweger syndrome
        and neonata...


        ATXN2: This gene belongs to a group of genes that is associated with microsatellite-expansion
        diseases, a class of neurological and neuromuscular disorders caused by expansion
        of short stretches of repetitive DNA. The protein encoded by this gene has
        two globular domains near the N-terminus, one of which contains a clathrin-mediated
        trans-Golgi signal and an endoplasmic reticulum exit signal. The encoded cytoplasmic
        protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane, is involved
        in endocytosis, and modulates mTOR signals, modifying ribosomal translation
        and mitochondrial function. The N-terminal region of the protein contains
        a polyglutamine tract of 14-31 residues that can be expanded in the pathogenic
        state to 32-200 residues. Intermediate length expansions of this tract increase
        susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, while long expansions of
        this tract result in spinocerebellar ataxia-2, an autosomal-dominantly inherited,
        neurodegenerative disorder. Genome-wide ...

        pathway used to deliver membrane-bound proteins and exo...


        CYP51A1: This gene encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of
        enzymes. The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many
        reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids
        and other lipids. This endoplasmic reticulum protein participates in the synthesis
        of cholesterol by catalyzing the removal of the 14alpha-methyl group from
        lanosterol. Homologous genes are found in all three eukaryotic phyla, fungi,
        plants, and animals, suggesting that this is one of the oldest cytoc...

        LDLR: The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family consists of
        cell surface proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific
        ligands. The encoded protein is normally bound at the cell membrane, where
        it binds low density lipoprotein/cholesterol and is taken into the cell. Lysosomes
        release the cholesterol, which is made available for repression of microsomal
        enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting
        step in cholesterol synthesis. At the same time, a reciprocal stimulation
        of cholesterol ester synthesis takes place. Mutations in this gene cause ...

        FBXO6: This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family which is characterized
        by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F-box. The F-box proteins constitute
        one of the four subunits of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs
        (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination.
        The F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains,
        Fbls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different
        protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein
        encoded by this gene belongs to the Fbxs class, and its C-terminal ...

        STARD4: Cholesterol homeostasis is regulated, at least in part, by sterol
        regulatory element (SRE)-binding proteins (e.g., SREBP1; MIM 184756) and by
        liver X receptors (e.g., LXRA; MIM 602423). Upon sterol depletion, LXRs are
        inactive and SREBPs are cleaved, after which they bind promoter SREs and activate
        genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake. Sterol transport is
        mediated by vesicles or by soluble protein carriers, such as steroidogenic
        acute regulatory protein (STAR; MIM 600617). STAR is homologous to a family
        of proteins containing a 200- to 210...

        vessels. Alternative spli...


        GSTM2: Cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of glutathione S-transferase are
        encoded by two distinct supergene families. At present, eight distinct classes
        of the soluble cytoplasmic mammalian glutathione S-transferases have been
        identified: alpha, kappa, mu, omega, pi, sigma, theta and zeta. This gene
        encodes a glutathione S-transferase that belongs to the mu class. The mu class
        of enzymes functions in the detoxification of electrophilic compounds, including
        carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative
        stress, by conjugation with glutathione. The genes encoding the mu class of

      summary: ' This list of genes is primarily involved in cholesterol and lipid
        regulation, metabolism, and transport. Pathways involving regulation of DNA-templated
        transcription and response to endoplasmic reticulum stress were also noted.


        Mechanism: This list of genes are thought to regulate cholesterol, lipid and
        fatty acid metabolism, transport, and storage by binding, transferring, and
        desaturation activity. They contribute to a variety of downstream metabolic
        processes by acting as enzymes, transcription activators, and response regulators.
        The underlying biological mechanism is thought to involve an intricate network
        of signaling pathways, cellular components, and transcriptional regulation
        that regulate the production and metabolism of lipids within the cell.
