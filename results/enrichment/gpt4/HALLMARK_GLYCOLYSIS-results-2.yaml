        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

      response_text: 'Summary: Glycosylation and carbohydrate metabolism are enriched
        functions in this list of genes.


        Mechanism: Glycosylation is a key process in carbohydrate metabolism, involving
        the addition of carbohydrate groups to proteins and lipids to form glycoproteins
        and glycolipids, respectively. These modifications are critical for proper
        protein folding, stability, and secretion, as well as for cell-cell recognition

        Enriched Terms: Galactosyltransferase activity; glucuronosyltransferase activity;

        glucosaminyl-proteoglycan 3-beta-glucosyltransferase activity; hexosyltransferase
        activity; keratan sulfotransferase activity; nucleotidyltransferase activity


        Hypothesis: The enriched functions in these genes suggest a critical role
        for glycosylation and carbohydrate metabolism in a variety of physiological
        processes and perhaps a possible link between glycosylation and pathologies.
        Future studies could explore the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Mechanism: The listed genes are involved in glucose metabolism, glycolysis,

        mutase (PGAM), phosphomannose isomerase (MPI), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase

        Enriched Terms: Glycolysis; Carbohydrate metabolism


        Hypothesis: The enriched terms suggest a possible link between the listed
        genes and the glycolysis pathway, which is a central metabolic pathway in
        energy production. The genes encode enzymes that are involved in the conversion
        of glucose into pyruvate, which is further metabolized in the Krebs cycle.
        Dysfunction in these genes may lead to alterations in glucose metabolism and

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1

        Mechanism: These genes are involved in various aspects of carbohydrate metabolism,

        as nucleotide-sugar metabolism.


        Enriched Terms: glucuronosyltransferase activity; glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis;

        metabolism; UDP-galactosyltransferase activity; UDP-glucose 4-epimerase activity.


        Hypothesis: The enriched terms suggest that these genes are involved in the
        biosynthesis of complex carbohydrates and nucleotide-sugars. This may be related
        to the regulation of cell surface glycans and extracellular matrix components,
        which can impact cell signaling and adhesion. Dysregulation of these processes

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.
