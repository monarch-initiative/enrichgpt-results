        Mechanism: Peroxisomes are organelles that house crucial metabolic reactions.
        Peroxisome biogenesis occurs via two pathways: the ER-associated assembly
        (ERAA) pathway and the peroxisomal membrane proliferation (PMP) pathway.

        Hypothesis: The significant enrichment of genes involved in peroxisome organization
        and biogenesis suggests that these genes play a critical role in regulating
        peroxisome function. Dysregulation of these genes may lead to peroxisomal
        disorders such as Zellweger syndrome. Further investigation of these genes

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.
