        TTN: This gene encodes a large abundant protein of striated muscle. The product
        of this gene is divided into two regions, a N-terminal I-band and a C-terminal
        A-band. The I-band, which is the elastic part of the molecule, contains two
        regions of tandem immunoglobulin domains on either side of a PEVK region that
        is rich in proline, glutamate, valine and lysine. The A-band, which is thought
        to act as a protein-ruler, contains a mixture of immunoglobulin and fibronectin
        repeats, and possesses kinase activity. An N-terminal Z-disc region and a
        C-terminal M-line region bind to the Z-line and M-line of the sarcomere, respectively,
        so that a single titin molecule spans half the length of a sarcomere. Titin
        also contains binding sites for muscle associated prote...

        T subu...


        TNNT3: The binding of Ca(2+) to the trimeric troponin complex initiates the
        process of muscle contraction. Increased Ca(2+) concentrations produce a conformational
        change in the troponin complex that is transmitted to tropomyosin dimers situated
        along actin filaments. The altered conformation permits increased interaction
        between a myosin head and an actin filament which, ultimately, produces a
        muscle contraction. The troponin complex has protein subunits C, I, and T.
        Subunit C binds Ca(2+) and subunit I binds to actin and inhibits actin-myosin
        interaction. Subunit T binds the troponin complex to the tropomyosin complex

        of this gene is divided into two regions, a N-terminal I-band and a C-terminal
        A-band. The I-band, which is the elastic part of the molecule, contains two
        regions of tandem immunoglobulin domains on either side of a PEVK region that
        is rich in proline, glutamate, valine and lysine. The A-band, which is thought
        to act as a protein-ruler, contains a mixture of immunoglobulin and fibronectin
        repeats, and possesses kinase activity. An N-terminal Z-disc region and a
        C-terminal M-line region bind to the Z-line and M-line of the sarcomere, respectively,
        so that a single titin molecule spans half the length of a sarcomere. Titin
        also contains binding sites for muscle associated prote...

        filament disassembly. Mutations in this gene have been...


        MYPN: Striated muscle in vertebrates comprises large proteins which must be
        organized properly to contract efficiently. Z-lines in striated muscle are
        a sign of this organization, representing the ends of actin thin filaments,
        titin, nebulin or nebulette and accessory proteins required for structure
        and function. This gene encodes a protein whi...


        NEB: This gene encodes nebulin, a giant protein component of the cytoskeletal
        matrix that coexists with the thick and thin filaments within the sarcomeres
        of skeletal muscle. In most vertebrates, nebulin accounts for 3 to 4% of the
        total myofibrillar protein. The encoded protein contains approximately 30-amino
        acid long modules that can be classified into 7 types and other repeated modules.

        protein may play a role in the...


        TMOD4: Predicted to enable tropomyosin binding activity. Predicted to be involved
        in actin filament organization; muscle contraction...


        TNNC2: Troponin (Tn), a key protein complex in the regulation of striated
        muscle contraction, is composed of 3 subunits. The Tn-I subunit inhibits actomyosin
        ATPase, the Tn-T subunit binds tropomyosin and Tn-C, whi...


        TNNI1: Troponin proteins associate with tropomyosin and regulate the calcium
        sensitivity of the myofibril contractile apparatus of striated muscles. Troponin
        I (TnI), along with troponin T (TnT) and troponin C (TnC), is one of 3 subunits
        that form the troponin complex of the thin filaments of striated muscle. TnI
        is the inhibitory subunit; blocking actin-myosin interactions and thereby
        mediating striated muscle relaxation. The TnI subfamily contains three genes:
        TnI-skeletal-fast-twitch, TnI-skeletal-slow-twitch, and TnI-cardiac. The TnI-fast
        and TnI-slow gen...


        TNNT1: This gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of troponin, which is
        a regulatory complex located on the thin filament of the sarcomere. This complex
        regulates striated muscle contraction in response to fluctuations in intracellular
        calcium concentration. This complex is composed of three subunits: troponin
        C, which binds calcium, troponin T, which binds tropomyosin, and troponin
        I, which is an inhibitory subunit. This protein is the slow skeletal troponin
        T subu...


        TNNT3: The binding of Ca(2+) to the trimeric troponin complex initiates the
        process of muscle contraction. Increased Ca(2+) concentrations produce a conformational
        change in the troponin complex that is transmitted to tropomyosin dimers situated
        along actin filaments. The altered conformation permits increased interaction
        between a myosin head and an actin filament which, ultimately, produces a
        muscle contraction. The troponin complex has protein subunits C, I, and T.
        Subunit C binds Ca(2+) and subunit I binds to actin and inhibits actin-myosin
        interaction. Subunit T binds the troponin complex to the tropomyosin complex
        and is also required for Ca(2+)-mediated activation of actomyosin ATPase activity.
        Th...


        TRDN: This gene encodes an integral membrane protein found in skeletal and
        cardiac muscle. The encoded protein plays a role in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction
        coupling as part of the calcium release complex and is required for normal
        skeletal muscle strength. ...


        TRIM63: This gene encodes a member of the RING zinc finger protein family
        found in striated muscle and iris. The product of this gene is an E3 ubiquitin
        ligase that localizes to the Z-line and M-line lattices of myofibrils. This
        protein plays an import...


        TTN: This gene encodes a large abundant protein of striated muscle. The product
        of this gene is divided into two regions, a N-terminal I-band and a C-terminal
        A-band. The I-band, which is the elastic part of the molecule, contains two
        regions of tandem immunoglobulin domains on either side of a PEVK region that
        is rich in proline, glutamate, valine and lysine. The A-band, which is thought
        to act as a protein-ruler, contains a mixture of immunoglobulin and fibronectin
        repeats, and possesses kinase activity. An N-terminal Z-disc region and a
        C-terminal M-line region bind to the Z-line and M-line of the sarcomere, respectively,
        so that a single titin molecule spans half the length of a sarcomere. Titin
        also contains binding sites for muscle associated prote...

        actin cytoskeleton organization and heart development. Predicted to act upstream
        of or within cardiac muscle tissue morp...

        while beta and gamma actins are involved in the regulation of cell motility.
        This actin is an alpha actin that is found in skeletal muscle. Mutations in
        this gene cause a variety of myopathies, i...


        TNNT3: The binding of Ca(2+) to the trimeric troponin complex initiates the
        process of muscle contraction. Increased Ca(2+) concentrations produce a conformational
        change in the troponin complex that is transmitted to tropomyosin dimers situated
        along actin filaments. The altered conformation permits increased interaction
        between a myosin head and an actin filament which, ultimately, produces a
        muscle contraction. The troponin complex has protein subunits C, I, and T.
        Subunit C binds Ca(2+) and subunit I binds to actin and inhibits actin-myosin
        interaction. Subunit T binds the troponin complex to the tropomyosin complex
        and is also required for Ca(2+)-mediated activation of actomyosin ATPase activity.
        There are 3 different troponin T genes that encode tissue-specific isoforms
        of subunit T for fast skeletal-, slow skeletal-, and cardiac-muscle. This
        gene encodes fast skeletal t...

        calcium sensor in both cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. This protein, also
        known as calmitine, functions as a calcium regulator ...


        KCNT1: Potassium channels represent the most complex class of voltage-gated
        ion channels from both functional and structural standpoints. Their diverse
        functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin

        COX6A2: Cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial
        respiratory chain, catalyzes the electron transfer from reduced cytochrome
        c to oxygen. It is a heteromeric complex consisting of 3 catalytic subunits
        encoded by mitochondrial genes and multiple structural subunits encoded by

        TTN: This gene encodes a large abundant protein of striated muscle. The product
        of this gene is divided into two regions, a N-terminal I-band and a C-terminal
        A-band. The I-band, which is the elastic part of the molecule, contains two
        regions of tandem immunoglobulin domains on either side of a PEVK region that
        is rich in proline, glutamate, valine and lysine. The A-band, which is thought
        to act as a protein-ruler, contains a mixture of immunoglobulin and fibronectin
        repeats, and possesses kinase activity. An N-terminal Z-disc region and a
        C-terminal M-line region bind to the Z-line and M-line of the sarcomere, respectively,
        so that a single titin molecule spans half the length of a sarcomere. Titin
        also contains binding sites for muscle associated proteins so it serves as
        an adhesion template for the assembly of contractile machinery in muscle cells.
        It has also been identified as a structural protein for chromosomes. Alternative
        splicing ...

        LRRC14B: The protein encoded by this gene is a leucine-rich repeat containing
        protein that is a membe...


        NEB: This gene encodes nebulin, a giant protein component of the cytoskeletal
        matrix that coexists with the thick and thin filaments within the sarcomeres
        of skeletal muscle. In most vertebrates, nebulin accounts for 3 to 4% of the
        total myofibrillar protein. The encoded protein contains approximately 30-amino
        acid long modules that can be classified into 7 types and other repeated modules.
        Protein isoform sizes vary from 600 to 800 kD due to alternative splicing
        that is tissue-, species-,and developmental stage-specific. Of the 183 exons
        in the nebulin gene, at least 43 are altern...

        muscular dystrophy and myofibrillar myopa...


        TNNI1: Troponin proteins associate with tropomyosin and regulate the calcium
        sensitivity of the myofibril contractile apparatus of striated muscles. Troponin
        I (TnI), along with troponin T (TnT) and troponin C (TnC), is one of 3 subunits
        that form the troponin complex of the thin filaments of striated muscle. TnI
        is the inhibitory subunit; blocking actin-myosin interactions and thereby
        mediating striated muscle relaxation. The TnI subfamily contains three genes:
        TnI-skeletal-fast-twitch, TnI-skeletal-slow-twitch, and TnI-cardiac. The TnI-fast

        light cha...


        TNNT1: This gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of troponin, which is
        a regulatory complex located on the thin filament of the sarcomere. This complex

        calcium concentration. This complex is composed of three subunits: troponin
        C, which binds calcium, troponin T, which binds tropomyosin, and troponin
        I, which is an inhibitory subunit. This protein is the slow skeletal troponin
        T subunit. Mutations in this gene cause nemaline myopathy type 5, also known
        as Amish nemaline myopathy, a neuromuscular di...

        TNNT3: The binding of Ca(2+) to the trimeric troponin complex initiates the
        process of muscle contraction. Increased Ca(2+) concentrations produce a conformational
        change in the troponin complex that is transmitted to tropomyosin dimers situated
        along actin filaments. The altered conformation permits increased interaction
        between a myosin head and an actin filament which, ultimately, produces a
        muscle contraction. The troponin complex has protein subunits C, I, and T.
        Subunit C binds Ca(2+) and subunit I binds to actin and inhibits actin-myosin
        interaction. Subunit T binds the troponin complex to the tropomyosin complex
        and is also required for Ca(2+)-mediated activation of actomyosin ATPase activity.
        There are 3 different troponin T genes that encode tissue-specific isoforms
        of subunit T for fast skeletal-, slow skeletal-, and cardiac-muscle. This
        gene encodes fast skeletal t...

        TTN: This gene encodes a large abundant protein of striated muscle. The product
        of this gene is divided into two regions, a N-terminal I-band and a C-terminal
        A-band. The I-band, which is the elastic part of the molecule, contains two
        regions of tandem immunoglobulin domains on either side of a PEVK region that
        is rich in proline, glutamate, valine and lysine. The A-band, which is thought
        to act as a protein-ruler, contains a mixture of immunoglobulin and fibronectin
        repeats, and possesses kinase activity. An N-terminal Z-disc region and a
        C-terminal M-line region bind to the Z-line and M-line of the sarcomere, respectively,
        so that a single titin molecule spans half the length of a sarcomere. Titin

        Here are the gene summaries:



        ACTA1: The product encoded by this gene belongs to the actin family of proteins,
        which are highly conserved proteins that play a role in cell motility, structure
        and integrity. Alpha, beta and gamma actin isoforms have been identified,
        with alpha actins being a major constituent of the contractile apparatus,
        while beta and gamma actins are involved in the regulation of cell motility.
        This actin is an alpha actin that is found in skeletal muscle. Mutations in
        this gene cause a variety of myopathies, i...


        TNNT3: The binding of Ca(2+) to the trimeric troponin complex initiates the
        process of muscle contraction. Increased Ca(2+) concentrations produce a conformational
        change in the troponin complex that is transmitted to tropomyosin dimers situated
        along actin filaments. The altered conformation permits increased interaction
        between a myosin head and an actin filament which, ultimately, produces a
        muscle contraction. The troponin complex has protein subunits C, I, and T.
        Subunit C binds Ca(2+) and subunit I binds to actin and inhibits actin-myosin
        interaction. Subunit T binds the troponin complex to the tropomyosin complex
        and is also required for Ca(2+)-mediated activation of actomyosin ATPase activity.
        There are 3 different troponin T genes that encode tissue-specific isoforms
        of subunit T for fast skeletal-, slow skeletal-, and cardiac-muscle. This
        gene encodes fast skeletal t...

        TTN: This gene encodes a large abundant protein of striated muscle. The product
        of this gene is divided into two regions, a N-terminal I-band and a C-terminal
        A-band. The I-band, which is the elastic part of the molecule, contains two
        regions of tandem immunoglobulin domains on either side of a PEVK region that
        is rich in proline, glutamate, valine and lysine. The A-band, which is thought
        to act as a protein-ruler, contains a mixture of immunoglobulin and fibronectin
        repeats, and possesses kinase activity. An N-terminal Z-disc region and a
        C-terminal M-line region bind to the Z-line and M-line of the sarcomere, respectively,
        so that a single titin molecule spans half the length of a sarcomere. Titin
        also contains binding sites for muscle associated proteins so it serves as
        an adhesion template for the assembly of contractile machinery in muscle cells.
        It has also been identified as a structural protein for chromosomes. Alternative
        splicing ...

        LRRC14B: The protein encoded by this gene is a leucine-rich repeat containing
        protein that is a membe...


        NEB: This gene encodes nebulin, a giant protein component of the cytoskeletal
        matrix that coexists with the thick and thin filaments within the sarcomeres
        of skeletal muscle. In most vertebrates, nebulin accounts for 3 to 4% of the
        total myofibrillar protein. The encoded protein contains approximately 30-amino
        acid long modules that can be classified into 7 types and other repeated modules.
        Protein isoform sizes vary from 600 to 800 kD due to alternative splicing
        that is tissue-, species-,and developmental stage-specific. Of the 183 exons
        in the nebulin gene, at least 43 are altern...

        TNNT3: The binding of Ca(2+) to the trimeric troponin complex initiates the
        process of muscle contraction. Increased Ca(2+) concentrations produce a conformational
        change in the troponin complex that is transmitted to tropomyosin dimers situated
        along actin filaments. The altered conformation permits increased interaction
        between a myosin head and an actin filament which, ultimately, produces a
        muscle contraction. The troponin complex has protein subunits C, I, and T.
        Subunit C binds Ca(2+) and subunit I binds to actin and inhibits actin-myosin
        interaction. Subunit T binds the troponin complex to the tropomyosin complex
        and is also required for Ca(2+)-mediated activation of actomyosin ATPase activity.
        There are 3 different troponin T genes that encode tissue-specific isoforms
        of subunit T for fast skeletal-, slow skeletal-, and cardiac-muscle. This
        gene encodes fast skeletal t...

        TTN: This gene encodes a large abundant protein of striated muscle. The product
        of this gene is divided into two regions, a N-terminal I-band and a C-terminal
        A-band. The I-band, which is the elastic part of the molecule, contains two
        regions of tandem immunoglobulin domains on either side of a PEVK region that
        is rich in proline, glutamate, valine and lysine. The A-band, which is thought
        to act as a protein-ruler, contains a mixture of immunoglobulin and fibronectin
        repeats, and possesses kinase activity. An N-terminal Z-disc region and a
        C-terminal M-line region bind to the Z-line and M-line of the sarcomere, respectively,
        so that a single titin molecule spans half the length of a sarcomere. Titin
        also contains binding sites for muscle associated proteins so it serves as
        an adhesion template for the assembly of contractile machinery in muscle cells.
        It has also been identified as a structural protein for chromosomes. Alternative

        NEB: This gene encodes nebulin, a giant protein component of the cytoskeletal
        matrix that coexists with the thick and thin filaments within the sarcomeres
        of skeletal muscle. In most vertebrates, nebulin accounts for 3 to 4% of the
        total myofibrillar protein. The encoded protein contains approximately 30-amino
        acid long modules that can be classified into 7 types and other repeated modules.
        Protein isoform sizes vary from 600 to 800 kD due to alternative splicing
        that is tissue-, species-,and developmental stage-specific. Of the 183 exons
        in the nebulin gene, at least 43 are altern...

        muscular dystrophy and myofibrillar myopa...


        TNNI1: Troponin proteins associate with tropomyosin and regulate the calcium
        sensitivity of the myofibril contractile apparatus of striated muscles. Troponin
        I (TnI), along with troponin T (TnT) and troponin C (TnC), is one of 3 subunits
        that form the troponin complex of the thin filaments of striated muscle. TnI

        light cha...


        TNNT1: This gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of troponin, which is
        a regulatory complex located on the thin filament of the sarcomere. This complex
        regulates striated muscle contraction in response to fluctuations in intracellular
        calcium concentration. This complex is composed of three subunits: troponin
        C, which binds calcium, troponin T, which binds tropomyosin, and troponin
        I, which is an inhibitory subunit. This protein is the slow skeletal troponin
        T subunit. Mutations in this gene cause nemaline myopathy type 5, also known
        as Amish nemaline myopathy, a neuromuscular di...
