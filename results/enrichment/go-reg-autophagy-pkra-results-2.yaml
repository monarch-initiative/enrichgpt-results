        Here are the gene summaries:



        AKT1: This gene encodes one of the three members of the human AKT serine-threonine
        protein kinase family which are often referred to as protein kinase B alpha,
        beta, and gamma. These highly similar AKT proteins all have an N-terminal
        pleckstrin homology domain, a serine/threonine-specific kinase domain and
        a C-terminal regulatory domain. These proteins are phosphorylated by phosphoinositide
        3-kinase (PI3K). AKT/PI3K forms a key component of many signalling pathways
        that involve the binding of membrane-bound ligands such as receptor tyrosine
        kinases, G-protein coupled receptors, and integrin-linked kinase. These AKT
        proteins therefore regulate a wide variety of cellular functions including
        cell proliferation, survival, metabolism, and angiogenesis in both normal
        and malignant cells. AKT proteins are recruited to the cell membrane by phosphatidylinositol
        3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) after phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
        (PIP2) by PI3K. Subsequent phosphorylation of both threonine residue 308 and
        serine residue 473 is required for full activation of the AKT1 protein encoded
        by this gene. Phosphorylation of additional residues also occurs, for example,
        in response to insulin growth factor-1 and epidermal growth factor. Protein
        phosphatases act as negative regulators of AKT proteins by dephosphorylating
        AKT or PIP3. The PI3K/AKT signalling pathway is crucial for tumor cell survival.
        Survival factors can suppress apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner
        by activating AKT1 which then phosphorylates and inactivates components of
        the apoptotic machinery. AKT proteins also participate in the mammalian target
        of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway which controls the assembly of the
        eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4E) complex and this pathway,
        in addition to responding to extracellular signals from growth factors and
        cytokines, is disregulated in many cancers. Mutations in this gene are associated
        with multiple types of cancer and excessive tissue growth including Proteus
        syndrome and Cowden syndrome 6, and breast, colorectal, and ovarian cancers.
        Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this
        gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2020]


        CASP3: The protein encoded by this gene is a cysteine-aspartic acid protease
        that plays a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis. The encoded
        protein cleaves and inactivates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase while it cleaves
        and activates sterol regulatory element binding proteins as well as caspases
        6, 7, and 9. This protein itself is processed by caspases 8, 9, and 10. It
        is the predominant caspase involved in the cleavage of amyloid-beta 4A precursor
        protein, which is associated with neuronal death in Alzheimer''s disease.
        [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        CCNY: Cyclins, such as CCNY, control cell division cycles and regulate cyclin-dependent
        kinases (e.g., CDC2; MIM 116940) (Li et al., 2009 [PubMed 18060517]).[supplied
        by OMIM, May 2009]


        CDK5R1: The protein encoded by this gene (p35) is a neuron-specific activator
        of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5); the activation of CDK5 is required for
        proper development of the central nervous system. The p35 form of this protein
        is proteolytically cleaved by calpain, generating a p25 form. The cleavage
        of p35 into p25 results in relocalization of the protein from the cell periphery
        to nuclear and perinuclear regions. P25 deregulates CDK5 activity by prolonging
        its activation and changing its cellular location. The p25 form accumulates
        in the brain neurons of patients with Alzheimer''s disease. This accumulation
        correlates with an increase in CDK5 kinase activity, and may lead to aberrantly
        phosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau, which contributes
        to Alzheimer''s disease. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        HSPB1: This gene encodes a member of the small heat shock protein (HSP20)
        family of proteins. In response to environmental stress, the encoded protein
        translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and functions as a molecular
        chaperone that promotes the correct folding of other proteins. This protein
        plays an important role in the differentiation of a wide variety of cell types.
        Expression of this gene is correlated with poor clinical outcome in multiple
        human cancers, and the encoded protein may promote cancer cell proliferation
        and metastasis, while protecting cancer cells from apoptosis. Mutations in
        this gene have been identified in human patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
        disease and distal hereditary motor neuropathy. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        IRGM: This gene encodes a member of the p47 immunity-related GTPase family.
        The encoded protein may play a role in the innate immune response by regulating
        autophagy formation in response to intracellular pathogens. Polymorphisms
        that affect the normal expression of this gene are associated with a susceptibility
        to Crohn''s disease and tuberculosis. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Oct
        2016]


        KAT5: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the MYST family of histone
        acetyl transferases (HATs) and was originally isolated as an HIV-1 TAT-interactive
        protein. HATs play important roles in regulating chromatin remodeling, transcription
        and other nuclear processes by acetylating histone and nonhistone proteins.
        This protein is a histone acetylase that has a role in DNA repair and apoptosis
        and is thought to play an important role in signal transduction. Alternative
        splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by
        RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        MLST8: Enables protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity. Involved
        in TORC1 signaling; positive regulation of TOR signaling; and regulation of
        actin cytoskeleton organization. Part of TORC1 complex and TORC2 complex.
        [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        NOD2: This gene is a member of the Nod1/Apaf-1 family and encodes a protein
        with two caspase recruitment (CARD) domains and six leucine-rich repeats (LRRs).
        The protein is primarily expressed in the peripheral blood leukocytes. It
        plays a role in the immune response to intracellular bacterial lipopolysaccharides
        (LPS) by recognizing the muramyl dipeptide (MDP) derived from them and activating
        the NFKB protein. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Crohn disease
        and Blau syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2014]


        PIK3CA: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is composed of an 85 kDa regulatory
        subunit and a 110 kDa catalytic subunit. The protein encoded by this gene
        represents the catalytic subunit, which uses ATP to phosphorylate PtdIns,
        PtdIns4P and PtdIns(4,5)P2. This gene has been found to be oncogenic and has
        been implicated in cervical cancers. A pseudogene of this gene has been defined
        on chromosome 22. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2016]


        RPTOR: This gene encodes a component of a signaling pathway that regulates
        cell growth in response to nutrient and insulin levels. The encoded protein
        forms a stoichiometric complex with the mTOR kinase, and also associates with
        eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 and ribosomal protein S6
        kinase. The protein positively regulates the downstream effector ribosomal
        protein S6 kinase, and negatively regulates the mTOR kinase. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Sep 2009]


        SMCR8: Enables protein kinase binding activity and protein kinase inhibitor
        activity. Contributes to guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity. Involved
        in negative regulation of macromolecule metabolic process; regulation of TOR
        signaling; and regulation of macroautophagy. Located in chromatin; cytoplasm;
        and nucleoplasm. Part of guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor complex. Colocalizes
        with Atg1/ULK1 kinase complex. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources,
        Apr 2022]


        SNCA: Alpha-synuclein is a member of the synuclein family, which also includes
        beta- and gamma-synuclein. Synucleins are abundantly expressed in the brain
        and alpha- and beta-synuclein inhibit phospholipase D2 selectively. SNCA may
        serve to integrate presynaptic signaling and membrane trafficking. Defects
        in SNCA have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. SNCA
        peptides are a major component of amyloid plaques in the brains of patients
        with Alzheimer''s disease. Alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different
        isoforms have been identified for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        STING1: This gene encodes a five transmembrane protein that functions as a
        major regulator of the innate immune response to viral and bacterial infections.
        The encoded protein is a pattern recognition receptor that detects cytosolic
        nucleic acids and transmits signals that activate type I interferon responses.
        The encoded protein has also been shown to play a role in apoptotic signaling
        by associating with type II major histocompatibility complex. Mutations in
        this gene are the cause of infantile-onset STING-associated vasculopathy.
        Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq,
        Sep 2014]


        STK11: The protein encoded by this gene is a serine/threonine kinase that
        regulates cell polarity and energy metabolism and functions as a tumor suppressor.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with the autosomal dominant Peutz-Jeghers
        syndrome, as well as with skin, pancreatic, and testicular cancers. [provided
        by RefSeq, May 2022]


        TAB2: The protein encoded by this gene is an activator of MAP3K7/TAK1, which
        is required for for the IL-1 induced activation of nuclear factor kappaB and
        MAPK8/JNK. This protein forms a kinase complex with TRAF6, MAP3K7 and TAB1,
        and it thus serves as an adaptor that links MAP3K7 and TRAF6. This protein,
        along with TAB1 and MAP3K7, also participates in the signal transduction induced
        by TNFSF11/RANKl through the activation of the receptor activator of NF-kappaB
        (TNFRSF11A/RANK), which may regulate the development and function of osteoclasts.
        Studies of the related mouse protein indicate that it functions to protect
        against liver damage caused by chemical stressors. Mutations in this gene
        cause congenital heart defects, multiple types, 2 (CHTD2). Alternative splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2014]


        TRIB3: The protein encoded by this gene is a putative protein kinase that
        is induced by the transcription factor NF-kappaB. The encoded protein is a
        negative regulator of NF-kappaB and can also sensitize cells to TNF- and TRAIL-induced
        apoptosis. In addition, this protein can negatively regulate the cell survival
        serine-threonine kinase AKT1. Differential promoter usage and alternate splicing
        result in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2014]

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Here are the gene summaries:



        AKT1: This gene encodes one of the three members of the human AKT serine-threonine
        protein kinase family which are often referred to as protein kinase B alpha,
        beta, and gamma. These highly similar AKT proteins all have an N-terminal
        pleckstrin homology domain, a serine/threonine-specific kinase domain and
        a C-terminal regulatory domain. These proteins are phosphorylated by phosphoinositide
        3-kinase (PI3K). AKT/PI3K forms a key component of many signalling pathways
        that involve the binding of membrane-bound ligands such as receptor tyrosine
        kinases, G-protein coupled receptors, and integrin-linked kinase. These AKT
        proteins therefore regulate a wide variety of cellular functions including
        cell proliferation, survival, metabolism, and angiogenesis in both normal
        and malignant cells. AKT proteins are recruited to the cell membrane by phosphatidylinositol
        3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) after phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
        (PIP2) by PI3K. Subsequent phosphorylation of both threonine residue 308 and
        serine residue 473 is required for full activation of the AKT1 protein encoded
        by this gene. Phosphorylation of additional residues also occurs, for example,
        in response to insulin growth factor-1 and epidermal growth factor. Protein
        phosphatases act as negative regulators of AKT proteins by dephosphorylating
        AKT or PIP3. The PI3K/AKT signalling pathway is crucial for tumor cell survival.
        Survival factors can suppress apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner
        by activating AKT1 which then phosphorylates and inactivates components of
        the apoptotic machinery. AKT proteins also participate in the mammalian target
        of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway which controls the assembly of the
        eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4E) complex and this pathway,
        in addition to responding to extracellular signals from growth factors and
        cytokines, is disregulated in many cancers. Mutations in this gene are associated
        with multiple types of cancer and excessive tissue growth including Proteus
        syndrome and Cowden syndrome 6, and breast, colorectal, and ovarian cancers.
        Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this
        gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2020]


        CASP3: The protein encoded by this gene is a cysteine-aspartic acid protease
        that plays a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis. The encoded
        protein cleaves and inactivates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase while it cleaves
        and activates sterol regulatory element binding proteins as well as caspases
        6, 7, and 9. This protein itself is processed by caspases 8, 9, and 10. It
        is the predominant caspase involved in the cleavage of amyloid-beta 4A precursor
        protein, which is associated with neuronal death in Alzheimer''s disease.
        [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        CCNY: Cyclins, such as CCNY, control cell division cycles and regulate cyclin-dependent
        kinases (e.g., CDC2; MIM 116940) (Li et al., 2009 [PubMed 18060517]).[supplied
        by OMIM, May 2009]


        CDK5R1: The protein encoded by this gene (p35) is a neuron-specific activator
        of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5); the activation of CDK5 is required for
        proper development of the central nervous system. The p35 form of this protein
        is proteolytically cleaved by calpain, generating a p25 form. The cleavage
        of p35 into p25 results in relocalization of the protein from the cell periphery
        to nuclear and perinuclear regions. P25 deregulates CDK5 activity by prolonging
        its activation and changing its cellular location. The p25 form accumulates
        in the brain neurons of patients with Alzheimer''s disease. This accumulation
        correlates with an increase in CDK5 kinase activity, and may lead to aberrantly
        phosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau, which contributes
        to Alzheimer''s disease. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        HSPB1: This gene encodes a member of the small heat shock protein (HSP20)
        family of proteins. In response to environmental stress, the encoded protein
        translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and functions as a molecular
        chaperone that promotes the correct folding of other proteins. This protein
        plays an important role in the differentiation of a wide variety of cell types.
        Expression of this gene is correlated with poor clinical outcome in multiple
        human cancers, and the encoded protein may promote cancer cell proliferation
        and metastasis, while protecting cancer cells from apoptosis. Mutations in
        this gene have been identified in human patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
        disease and distal hereditary motor neuropathy. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        IRGM: This gene encodes a member of the p47 immunity-related GTPase family.
        The encoded protein may play a role in the innate immune response by regulating
        autophagy formation in response to intracellular pathogens. Polymorphisms
        that affect the normal expression of this gene are associated with a susceptibility
        to Crohn''s disease and tuberculosis. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Oct
        2016]


        KAT5: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the MYST family of histone
        acetyl transferases (HATs) and was originally isolated as an HIV-1 TAT-interactive
        protein. HATs play important roles in regulating chromatin remodeling, transcription
        and other nuclear processes by acetylating histone and nonhistone proteins.
        This protein is a histone acetylase that has a role in DNA repair and apoptosis
        and is thought to play an important role in signal transduction. Alternative
        splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by
        RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        MLST8: Enables protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity. Involved
        in TORC1 signaling; positive regulation of TOR signaling; and regulation of
        actin cytoskeleton organization. Part of TORC1 complex and TORC2 complex.
        [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        NOD2: This gene is a member of the Nod1/Apaf-1 family and encodes a protein
        with two caspase recruitment (CARD) domains and six leucine-rich repeats (LRRs).
        The protein is primarily expressed in the peripheral blood leukocytes. It
        plays a role in the immune response to intracellular bacterial lipopolysaccharides
        (LPS) by recognizing the muramyl dipeptide (MDP) derived from them and activating
        the NFKB protein. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Crohn disease
        and Blau syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2014]


        PIK3CA: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is composed of an 85 kDa regulatory
        subunit and a 110 kDa catalytic subunit. The protein encoded by this gene
        represents the catalytic subunit, which uses ATP to phosphorylate PtdIns,
        PtdIns4P and PtdIns(4,5)P2. This gene has been found to be oncogenic and has
        been implicated in cervical cancers. A pseudogene of this gene has been defined
        on chromosome 22. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2016]


        RPTOR: This gene encodes a component of a signaling pathway that regulates
        cell growth in response to nutrient and insulin levels. The encoded protein
        forms a stoichiometric complex with the mTOR kinase, and also associates with
        eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 and ribosomal protein S6
        kinase. The protein positively regulates the downstream effector ribosomal
        protein S6 kinase, and negatively regulates the mTOR kinase. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Sep 2009]


        SMCR8: Enables protein kinase binding activity and protein kinase inhibitor
        activity. Contributes to guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity. Involved
        in negative regulation of macromolecule metabolic process; regulation of TOR
        signaling; and regulation of macroautophagy. Located in chromatin; cytoplasm;
        and nucleoplasm. Part of guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor complex. Colocalizes
        with Atg1/ULK1 kinase complex. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources,
        Apr 2022]


        SNCA: Alpha-synuclein is a member of the synuclein family, which also includes
        beta- and gamma-synuclein. Synucleins are abundantly expressed in the brain
        and alpha- and beta-synuclein inhibit phospholipase D2 selectively. SNCA may
        serve to integrate presynaptic signaling and membrane trafficking. Defects
        in SNCA have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. SNCA
        peptides are a major component of amyloid plaques in the brains of patients
        with Alzheimer''s disease. Alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different
        isoforms have been identified for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        STING1: This gene encodes a five transmembrane protein that functions as a
        major regulator of the innate immune response to viral and bacterial infections.
        The encoded protein is a pattern recognition receptor that detects cytosolic
        nucleic acids and transmits signals that activate type I interferon responses.
        The encoded protein has also been shown to play a role in apoptotic signaling
        by associating with type II major histocompatibility complex. Mutations in
        this gene are the cause of infantile-onset STING-associated vasculopathy.
        Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq,
        Sep 2014]


        STK11: The protein encoded by this gene is a serine/threonine kinase that
        regulates cell polarity and energy metabolism and functions as a tumor suppressor.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with the autosomal dominant Peutz-Jeghers
        syndrome, as well as with skin, pancreatic, and testicular cancers. [provided
        by RefSeq, May 2022]


        TAB2: The protein encoded by this gene is an activator of MAP3K7/TAK1, which
        is required for for the IL-1 induced activation of nuclear factor kappaB and
        MAPK8/JNK. This protein forms a kinase complex with TRAF6, MAP3K7 and TAB1,
        and it thus serves as an adaptor that links MAP3K7 and TRAF6. This protein,
        along with TAB1 and MAP3K7, also participates in the signal transduction induced
        by TNFSF11/RANKl through the activation of the receptor activator of NF-kappaB
        (TNFRSF11A/RANK), which may regulate the development and function of osteoclasts.
        Studies of the related mouse protein indicate that it functions to protect
        against liver damage caused by chemical stressors. Mutations in this gene
        cause congenital heart defects, multiple types, 2 (CHTD2). Alternative splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2014]


        TRIB3: The protein encoded by this gene is a putative protein kinase that
        is induced by the transcription factor NF-kappaB. The encoded protein is a
        negative regulator of NF-kappaB and can also sensitize cells to TNF- and TRAIL-induced
        apoptosis. In addition, this protein can negatively regulate the cell survival
        serine-threonine kinase AKT1. Differential promoter usage and alternate splicing
        result in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2014]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        AKT1: This gene encodes one of the three members of the human AKT serine-threonine
        protein kinase family which are often referred to as protein kinase B alpha,
        beta, and gamma. These highly similar AKT proteins all have an N-terminal
        pleckstrin homology domain, a serine/threonine-specific kinase domain and
        a C-terminal regulatory domain. These proteins are phosphorylated by phosphoinositide
        3-kinase (PI3K). AKT/PI3K forms a key component of many signalling pathways
        that involve the binding of membrane-bound ligands such as receptor tyrosine
        kinases, G-protein coupled receptors, and integrin-linked kinase. These AKT
        proteins therefore regulate a wide variety of cellular functions including
        cell proliferation, survival, metabolism, and angiogenesis in both normal
        and malignant cells. AKT proteins are recruited to the cell membrane by phosphatidylinositol
        3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) after phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
        (PIP2) by PI3K. Subsequent phosphorylation of both threonine residue 308 and
        serine residue 473 is required for full activation of the AKT1 protein encoded
        by this gene. Phosphorylation of additional residues also occurs, for example,
        in response to insulin growth factor-1 and epidermal growth factor. Protein
        phosphatases act as negative regulators of AKT proteins by dephosphorylating
        AKT or PIP3. The PI3K/AKT signalling pathway is crucial for tumor cell survival.
        Survival factors can suppress apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner
        by activating AKT1 which then phosphorylates and inactivates components of
        the apoptotic machinery. AKT proteins also participate in the mammalian target
        of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway which controls the assembly of the
        eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4E) complex and this pathway,
        in addition to responding to extracellular signals from growth factors and
        cytokines, is disregulated in many cancers. Mutations in this gene are associated
        with multiple types of cancer and excessive tissue growth including Proteus
        syndrome and Cowden syndrome 6, and breast, colorectal, and ovarian cancers.
        Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this
        gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2020]


        CASP3: The protein encoded by this gene is a cysteine-aspartic acid protease
        that plays a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis. The encoded
        protein cleaves and inactivates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase while it cleaves
        and activates sterol regulatory element binding proteins as well as caspases
        6, 7, and 9. This protein itself is processed by caspases 8, 9, and 10. It
        is the predominant caspase involved in the cleavage of amyloid-beta 4A precursor
        protein, which is associated with neuronal death in Alzheimer''s disease.

        CCNY: Cyclins, such as CCNY, control cell division cycles and regulate cyclin-dependent
        kinases (e.g., CDC2; MIM 116940) (Li et al., 2009 [PubMed 18060517]).[supplied
        by OMIM, May 2009]


        CDK5R1: The protein encoded by this gene (p35) is a neuron-specific activator
        of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5); the activation of CDK5 is required for
        proper development of the central nervous system. The p35 form of this protein
        is proteolytically cleaved by calpain, generating a p25 form. The cleavage
        of p35 into p25 results in relocalization of the protein from the cell periphery
        to nuclear and perinuclear regions. P25 deregulates CDK5 activity by prolonging
        its activation and changing its cellular location. The p25 form accumulates
        in the brain neurons of patients with Alzheimer''s disease. This accumulation
        correlates with an increase in CDK5 kinase activity, and may lead to aberrantly
        phosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau, which contributes
        to Alzheimer''s disease. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        HSPB1: This gene encodes a member of the small heat shock protein (HSP20)
        family of proteins. In response to environmental stress, the encoded protein
        translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and functions as a molecular
        chaperone that promotes the correct folding of other proteins. This protein
        plays an important role in the differentiation of a wide variety of cell types.
        Expression of this gene is correlated with poor clinical outcome in multiple
        human cancers, and the encoded protein may promote cancer cell proliferation
        and metastasis, while protecting cancer cells from apoptosis. Mutations in
        this gene have been identified in human patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
        disease and distal hereditary motor neuropathy. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        IRGM: This gene encodes a member of the p47 immunity-related GTPase family.
        The encoded protein may play a role in the innate immune response by regulating
        autophagy formation in response to intracellular pathogens. Polymorphisms
        that affect the normal expression of this gene are associated with a susceptibility
        to Crohn''s disease and tuberculosis. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Oct
        2016]


        KAT5: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the MYST family of histone
        acetyl transferases (HATs) and was originally isolated as an HIV-1 TAT-interactive
        protein. HATs play important roles in regulating chromatin remodeling, transcription
        and other nuclear processes by acetylating histone and nonhistone proteins.
        This protein is a histone acetylase that has a role in DNA repair and apoptosis
        and is thought to play an important role in signal transduction. Alternative
        splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by
        RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        MLST8: Enables protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity. Involved

        actin cytoskeleton organization. Part of TORC1 complex and TORC2 complex.
        [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        NOD2: This gene is a member of the Nod1/Apaf-1 family and encodes a protein
        with two caspase recruitment (CARD) domains and six leucine-rich repeats (LRRs).
        The protein is primarily expressed in the peripheral blood leukocytes. It
        plays a role in the immune response to intracellular bacterial lipopolysaccharides
        (LPS) by recognizing the muramyl dipeptide (MDP) derived from them and activating
        the NFKB protein. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Crohn disease
        and Blau syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2014]


        PIK3CA: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is composed of an 85 kDa regulatory
        subunit and a 110 kDa catalytic subunit. The protein encoded by this gene
        represents the catalytic subunit, which uses ATP to phosphorylate PtdIns,
        PtdIns4P and PtdIns(4,5)P2. This gene has been found to be oncogenic and has
        been implicated in cervical cancers. A pseudogene of this gene has been defined
        on chromosome 22. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2016]


        RPTOR: This gene encodes a component of a signaling pathway that regulates
        cell growth in response to nutrient and insulin levels. The encoded protein
        forms a stoichiometric complex with the mTOR kinase, and also associates with
        eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 and ribosomal protein S6
        kinase. The protein positively regulates the downstream effector ribosomal
        protein S6 kinase, and negatively regulates the mTOR kinase. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Sep 2009]


        SMCR8: Enables protein kinase binding activity and protein kinase inhibitor
        activity. Contributes to guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity. Involved
        in negative regulation of macromolecule metabolic process; regulation of TOR
        signaling; and regulation of macroautophagy. Located in chromatin; cytoplasm;
        and nucleoplasm. Part of guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor complex. Colocalizes
        with Atg1/ULK1 kinase complex. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources,
        Apr 2022]


        SNCA: Alpha-synuclein is a member of the synuclein family, which also includes
        beta- and gamma-synuclein. Synucleins are abundantly expressed in the brain
        and alpha- and beta-synuclein inhibit phospholipase D2 selectively. SNCA may
        serve to integrate presynaptic signaling and membrane trafficking. Defects
        in SNCA have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. SNCA
        peptides are a major component of amyloid plaques in the brains of patients
        with Alzheimer''s disease. Alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different
        isoforms have been identified for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        STING1: This gene encodes a five transmembrane protein that functions as a
        major regulator of the innate immune response to viral and bacterial infections.
        The encoded protein is a pattern recognition receptor that detects cytosolic
        nucleic acids and transmits signals that activate type I interferon responses.
        The encoded protein has also been shown to play a role in apoptotic signaling
        by associating with type II major histocompatibility complex. Mutations in
        this gene are the cause of infantile-onset STING-associated vasculopathy.
        Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq,
        Sep 2014]


        STK11: The protein encoded by this gene is a serine/threonine kinase that
        regulates cell polarity and energy metabolism and functions as a tumor suppressor.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with the autosomal dominant Peutz-Jeghers
        syndrome, as well as with skin, pancreatic, and testicular cancers. [provided
        by RefSeq, May 2022]


        TAB2: The protein encoded by this gene is an activator of MAP3K7/TAK1, which
        is required for for the IL-1 induced activation of nuclear factor kappaB and
        MAPK8/JNK. This protein forms a kinase complex with TRAF6, MAP3K7 and TAB1,
        and it thus serves as an adaptor that links MAP3K7 and TRAF6. This protein,
        along with TAB1 and MAP3K7, also participates in the signal transduction induced
        by TNFSF11/RANKl through the activation of the receptor activator of NF-kappaB
        (TNFRSF11A/RANK), which may regulate the development and function of osteoclasts.
        Studies of the related mouse protein indicate that it functions to protect
        against liver damage caused by chemical stressors. Mutations in this gene
        cause congenital heart defects, multiple types, 2 (CHTD2). Alternative splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2014]


        TRIB3: The protein encoded by this gene is a putative protein kinase that
        is induced by the transcription factor NF-kappaB. The encoded protein is a
        negative regulator of NF-kappaB and can also sensitize cells to TNF- and TRAIL-induced
        apoptosis. In addition, this protein can negatively regulate the cell survival
        serine-threonine kinase AKT1. Differential promoter usage and alternate splicing
        result in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2014]

        major regulator of the innate immune response to viral and bacterial infections.
        The encoded protein is a pattern recognition receptor that detects cytosolic
        nucleic acids and transmits signals that activate type I interferon responses.
        The encoded protein has also been shown to play a role in apoptotic signaling
        by associating with type II major histocompatibility complex. Mutations in
        this gene are the cause of infantile-onset STING-associated vasculopathy.
        Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq,
        Sep 2014]


        STK11: The protein encoded by this gene is a serine/threonine kinase that
        regulates cell polarity and energy metabolism and functions as a tumor suppressor.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with the autosomal dominant Peutz-Jeghers
        syndrome, as well as with skin, pancreatic, and testicular cancers. [provided
        by RefSeq, May 2022]


        TAB2: The protein encoded by this gene is an activator of MAP3K7/TAK1, which
        is required for for the IL-1 induced activation of nuclear factor kappaB and
        MAPK8/JNK. This protein forms a kinase complex with TRAF6, MAP3K7 and TAB1,
        and it thus serves as an adaptor that links MAP3K7 and TRAF6. This protein,
        along with TAB1 and MAP3K7, also participates in the signal transduction induced
        by TNFSF11/RANKl through the activation of the receptor activator of NF-kappaB
        (TNFRSF11A/RANK), which may regulate the development and function of osteoclasts.
        Studies of the related mouse protein indicate that it functions to protect
        against liver damage caused by chemical stressors. Mutations in this gene
        cause congenital heart defects, multiple types, 2 (CHTD2). Alternative splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2014]


        TRIB3: The protein encoded by this gene is a putative protein kinase that
        is induced by the transcription factor NF-kappaB. The encoded protein is a
        negative regulator of NF-kappaB and can also sensitize cells to TNF- and TRAIL-induced
        apoptosis. In addition, this protein can negatively regulate the cell survival
        serine-threonine kinase AKT1. Differential promoter usage and alternate splicing
        result in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2014]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        SNCA: Alpha-synuclein is a member of the synuclein family, which also includes
        beta- and gamma-synuclein. Synucleins are abundantly expressed in the brain
        and alpha- and beta-synuclein inhibit phospholipase D2 selectively. SNCA may
        serve to integrate presynaptic signaling and membrane trafficking. Defects
        in SNCA have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. SNCA
        peptides are a major component of amyloid plaques in the brains of patients
        with Alzheimer''s disease. Alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different
        isoforms have been identified for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        CASP3: The protein encoded by this gene is a cysteine-aspartic acid protease
        that plays a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis. The encoded
        protein cleaves and inactivates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase while it cleaves
        and activates sterol regulatory element binding proteins as well as caspases
        6, 7, and 9. This protein itself is processed by caspases 8, 9, and 10. It
        is the predominant caspase involved in the cleavage of amyloid-beta 4A precursor
        protein, which is associated with neuronal death in Alzheimer''s disease.
        [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        TRIB3: The protein encoded by this gene is a putative protein kinase that
        is induced by the transcription factor NF-kappaB. The encoded protein is a
        negative regulator of NF-kappaB and can also sensitize cells to TNF- and TRAIL-induced
        apoptosis. In addition, this protein can negatively regulate the cell survival
        serine-threonine kinase AKT1. Differential promoter usage and alternate splicing
        result in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2014]


        CCNY: Cyclins, such as CCNY, control cell division cycles and regulate cyclin-dependent
        kinases (e.g., CDC2; MIM 116940) (Li et al., 2009 [PubMed 18060517]).[supplied
        by OMIM, May 2009]


        PIK3CA: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is composed of an 85 kDa regulatory
        subunit and a 110 kDa catalytic subunit. The protein encoded by this gene
        represents the catalytic subunit, which uses ATP to phosphorylate PtdIns,
        PtdIns4P and PtdIns(4,5)P2. This gene has been found to be oncogenic and has
        been implicated in cervical cancers. A pseudogene of this gene has been defined
        on chromosome 22. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2016]


        AKT1: This gene encodes one of the three members of the human AKT serine-threonine
        protein kinase family which are often referred to as protein kinase B alpha,
        beta, and gamma. These highly similar AKT proteins all have an N-terminal
        pleckstrin homology domain, a serine/threonine-specific kinase domain and
        a C-terminal regulatory domain. These proteins are phosphorylated by phosphoinositide
        3-kinase (PI3K). AKT/PI3K forms a key component of many signalling pathways
        that involve the binding of membrane-bound ligands such as receptor tyrosine
        kinases, G-protein coupled receptors, and integrin-linked kinase. These AKT
        proteins therefore regulate a wide variety of cellular functions including
        cell proliferation, survival, metabolism, and angiogenesis in both normal
        and malignant cells. AKT proteins are recruited to the cell membrane by phosphatidylinositol
        3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) after phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
        (PIP2) by PI3K. Subsequent phosphorylation of both threonine residue 308 and
        serine residue 473 is required for full activation of the AKT1 protein encoded
        by this gene. Phosphorylation of additional residues also occurs, for example,
        in response to insulin growth factor-1 and epidermal growth factor. Protein
        phosphatases act as negative regulators of AKT proteins by dephosphorylating
        AKT or PIP3. The PI3K/AKT signalling pathway is crucial for tumor cell survival.
        Survival factors can suppress apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner
        by activating AKT1 which then phosphorylates and inactivates components of
        the apoptotic machinery. AKT proteins also participate in the mammalian target
        of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway which controls the assembly of the
        eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4E) complex and this pathway,
        in addition to responding to extracellular signals from growth factors and
        cytokines, is disregulated in many cancers. Mutations in this gene are associated
        with multiple types of cancer and excessive tissue growth including Proteus
        syndrome and Cowden syndrome 6, and breast, colorectal, and ovarian cancers.
        Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this
        gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2020]


        NOD2: This gene is a member of the Nod1/Apaf-1 family and encodes a protein
        with two caspase recruitment (CARD) domains and six leucine-rich repeats (LRRs).
        The protein is primarily expressed in the peripheral blood leukocytes. It
        plays a role in the immune response to intracellular bacterial lipopolysaccharides
        (LPS) by recognizing the muramyl dipeptide (MDP) derived from them and activating
        the NFKB protein. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Crohn disease
        and Blau syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2014]


        KAT5: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the MYST family of histone
        acetyl transferases (HATs) and was originally isolated as an HIV-1 TAT-interactive
        protein. HATs play important roles in regulating chromatin remodeling, transcription
        and other nuclear processes by acetylating histone and nonhistone proteins.
        This protein is a histone acetylase that has a role in DNA repair and apoptosis
        and is thought to play an important role in signal transduction. Alternative
        splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by
        RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        RPTOR: This gene encodes a component of a signaling pathway that regulates
        cell growth in response to nutrient and insulin levels. The encoded protein
        forms a stoichiometric complex with the mTOR kinase, and also associates with
        eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 and ribosomal protein S6
        kinase. The protein positively regulates the downstream effector ribosomal
        protein S6 kinase, and negatively regulates the mTOR kinase. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Sep 2009]


        SMCR8: Enables protein kinase binding activity and protein kinase inhibitor
        activity. Contributes to guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity. Involved
        in negative regulation of macromolecule metabolic process; regulation of TOR
        signaling; and regulation of macroautophagy. Located in chromatin; cytoplasm;
        and nucleoplasm. Part of guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor complex. Colocalizes
        with Atg1/ULK1 kinase complex. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources,
        Apr 2022]


        MLST8: Enables protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity. Involved
        in TORC1 signaling; positive regulation of TOR signaling; and regulation of
        actin cytoskeleton organization. Part of TORC1 complex and TORC2 complex.
        [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        TAB2: The protein encoded by this gene is an activator of MAP3K7/TAK1, which
        is required for for the IL-1 induced activation of nuclear factor kappaB and
        MAPK8/JNK. This protein forms a kinase complex with TRAF6, MAP3K7 and TAB1,
        and it thus serves as an adaptor that links MAP3K7 and TRAF6. This protein,
        along with TAB1 and MAP3K7, also participates in the signal transduction induced
        by TNFSF11/RANKl through the activation of the receptor activator of NF-kappaB
        (TNFRSF11A/RANK), which may regulate the development and function of osteoclasts.
        Studies of the related mouse protein indicate that it functions to protect
        against liver damage caused by chemical stressors. Mutations in this gene
        cause congenital heart defects, multiple types, 2 (CHTD2). Alternative splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2014]


        HSPB1: This gene encodes a member of the small heat shock protein (HSP20)
        family of proteins. In response to environmental stress, the encoded protein
        translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and functions as a molecular
        chaperone that promotes the correct folding of other proteins. This protein
        plays an important role in the differentiation of a wide variety of cell types.
        Expression of this gene is correlated with poor clinical outcome in multiple
        human cancers, and the encoded protein may promote cancer cell proliferation
        and metastasis, while protecting cancer cells from apoptosis. Mutations in
        this gene have been identified in human patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
        disease and distal hereditary motor neuropathy. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        IRGM: This gene encodes a member of the p47 immunity-related GTPase family.
        The encoded protein may play a role in the innate immune response by regulating
        autophagy formation in response to intracellular pathogens. Polymorphisms
        that affect the normal expression of this gene are associated with a susceptibility
        to Crohn''s disease and tuberculosis. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Oct
        2016]


        STK11: The protein encoded by this gene is a serine/threonine kinase that
        regulates cell polarity and energy metabolism and functions as a tumor suppressor.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with the autosomal dominant Peutz-Jeghers
        syndrome, as well as with skin, pancreatic, and testicular cancers. [provided
        by RefSeq, May 2022]


        CDK5R1: The protein encoded by this gene (p35) is a neuron-specific activator
        of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5); the activation of CDK5 is required for
        proper development of the central nervous system. The p35 form of this protein
        is proteolytically cleaved by calpain, generating a p25 form. The cleavage
        of p35 into p25 results in relocalization of the protein from the cell periphery
        to nuclear and perinuclear regions. P25 deregulates CDK5 activity by prolonging
        its activation and changing its cellular location. The p25 form accumulates
        in the brain neurons of patients with Alzheimer''s disease. This accumulation
        correlates with an increase in CDK5 kinase activity, and may lead to aberrantly
        phosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau, which contributes
        to Alzheimer''s disease. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        regulates cell polarity and energy metabolism and functions as a tumor suppressor.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with the autosomal dominant Peutz-Jeghers
        syndrome, as well as with skin, pancreatic, and testicular cancers. [provided
        by RefSeq, May 2022]


        CDK5R1: The protein encoded by this gene (p35) is a neuron-specific activator
        of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5); the activation of CDK5 is required for
        proper development of the central nervous system. The p35 form of this protein
        is proteolytically cleaved by calpain, generating a p25 form. The cleavage
        of p35 into p25 results in relocalization of the protein from the cell periphery
        to nuclear and perinuclear regions. P25 deregulates CDK5 activity by prolonging
        its activation and changing its cellular location. The p25 form accumulates
        in the brain neurons of patients with Alzheimer''s disease. This accumulation
        correlates with an increase in CDK5 kinase activity, and may lead to aberrantly
        phosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau, which contributes
        to Alzheimer''s disease. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        SNCA: Alpha-synuclein is a member of the synuclein family, which also includes
        beta- and gamma-synuclein. Synucleins are abundantly expressed in the brain
        and alpha- and beta-synuclein inhibit phospholipase D2 selectively. SNCA may
        serve to integrate presynaptic signaling and membrane trafficking. Defects
        in SNCA have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. SNCA
        peptides are a major component of amyloid plaques in the brains of patients
        with Alzheimer''s disease. Alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different
        isoforms have been identified for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        CASP3: The protein encoded by this gene is a cysteine-aspartic acid protease
        that plays a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis. The encoded
        protein cleaves and inactivates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase while it cleaves
        and activates sterol regulatory element binding proteins as well as caspases
        6, 7, and 9. This protein itself is processed by caspases 8, 9, and 10. It
        is the predominant caspase involved in the cleavage of amyloid-beta 4A precursor
        protein, which is associated with neuronal death in Alzheimer''s disease.
        [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        TRIB3: The protein encoded by this gene is a putative protein kinase that
        is induced by the transcription factor NF-kappaB. The encoded protein is a
        negative regulator of NF-kappaB and can also sensitize cells to TNF- and TRAIL-induced
        apoptosis. In addition, this protein can negatively regulate the cell survival
        serine-threonine kinase AKT1. Differential promoter usage and alternate splicing
        result in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2014]


        CCNY: Cyclins, such as CCNY, control cell division cycles and regulate cyclin-dependent
        kinases (e.g., CDC2; MIM 116940) (Li et al., 2009 [PubMed 18060517]).[supplied
        by OMIM, May 2009]


        PIK3CA: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is composed of an 85 kDa regulatory
        subunit and a 110 kDa catalytic subunit. The protein encoded by this gene
        represents the catalytic subunit, which uses ATP to phosphorylate PtdIns,
        PtdIns4P and PtdIns(4,5)P2. This gene has been found to be oncogenic and has
        been implicated in cervical cancers. A pseudogene of this gene has been defined
        on chromosome 22. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2016]


        AKT1: This gene encodes one of the three members of the human AKT serine-threonine
        protein kinase family which are often referred to as protein kinase B alpha,
        beta, and gamma. These highly similar AKT proteins all have an N-terminal
        pleckstrin homology domain, a serine/threonine-specific kinase domain and
        a C-terminal regulatory domain. These proteins are phosphorylated by phosphoinositide
        3-kinase (PI3K). AKT/PI3K forms a key component of many signalling pathways
        that involve the binding of membrane-bound ligands such as receptor tyrosine
        kinases, G-protein coupled receptors, and integrin-linked kinase. These AKT
        proteins therefore regulate a wide variety of cellular functions including
        cell proliferation, survival, metabolism, and angiogenesis in both normal
        and malignant cells. AKT proteins are recruited to the cell membrane by phosphatidylinositol
        3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) after phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
        (PIP2) by PI3K. Subsequent phosphorylation of both threonine residue 308 and
        serine residue 473 is required for full activation of the AKT1 protein encoded
        by this gene. Phosphorylation of additional residues also occurs, for example,
        in response to insulin growth factor-1 and epidermal growth factor. Protein
        phosphatases act as negative regulators of AKT proteins by dephosphorylating
        AKT or PIP3. The PI3K/AKT signalling pathway is crucial for tumor cell survival.
        Survival factors can suppress apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner
        by activating AKT1 which then phosphorylates and inactivates components of
        the apoptotic machinery. AKT proteins also participate in the mammalian target
        of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway which controls the assembly of the
        eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4E) complex and this pathway,
        in addition to responding to extracellular signals from growth factors and
        cytokines, is disregulated in many cancers. Mutations in this gene are associated
        with multiple types of cancer and excessive tissue growth including Proteus
        syndrome and Cowden syndrome 6, and breast, colorectal, and ovarian cancers.
        Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this
        gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2020]


        NOD2: This gene is a member of the Nod1/Apaf-1 family and encodes a protein
        with two caspase recruitment (CARD) domains and six leucine-rich repeats (LRRs).
        The protein is primarily expressed in the peripheral blood leukocytes. It
        plays a role in the immune response to intracellular bacterial lipopolysaccharides
        (LPS) by recognizing the muramyl dipeptide (MDP) derived from them and activating
        the NFKB protein. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Crohn disease
        and Blau syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2014]


        KAT5: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the MYST family of histone
        acetyl transferases (HATs) and was originally isolated as an HIV-1 TAT-interactive
        protein. HATs play important roles in regulating chromatin remodeling, transcription
        and other nuclear processes by acetylating histone and nonhistone proteins.
        This protein is a histone acetylase that has a role in DNA repair and apoptosis
        and is thought to play an important role in signal transduction. Alternative
        splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by
        RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        RPTOR: This gene encodes a component of a signaling pathway that regulates
        cell growth in response to nutrient and insulin levels. The encoded protein
        forms a stoichiometric complex with the mTOR kinase, and also associates with
        eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 and ribosomal protein S6
        kinase. The protein positively regulates the downstream effector ribosomal
        protein S6 kinase, and negatively regulates the mTOR kinase. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Sep 2009]


        SMCR8: Enables protein kinase binding activity and protein kinase inhibitor
        activity. Contributes to guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity. Involved
        in negative regulation of macromolecule metabolic process; regulation of TOR
        signaling; and regulation of macroautophagy. Located in chromatin; cytoplasm;
        and nucleoplasm. Part of guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor complex. Colocalizes
        with Atg1/ULK1 kinase complex. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources,
        Apr 2022]


        MLST8: Enables protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity. Involved
        in TORC1 signaling; positive regulation of TOR signaling; and regulation of
        actin cytoskeleton organization. Part of TORC1 complex and TORC2 complex.
        [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        TAB2: The protein encoded by this gene is an activator of MAP3K7/TAK1, which
        is required for for the IL-1 induced activation of nuclear factor kappaB and
        MAPK8/JNK. This protein forms a kinase complex with TRAF6, MAP3K7 and TAB1,
        and it thus serves as an adaptor that links MAP3K7 and TRAF6. This protein,
        along with TAB1 and MAP3K7, also participates in the signal transduction induced
        by TNFSF11/RANKl through the activation of the receptor activator of NF-kappaB
        (TNFRSF11A/RANK), which may regulate the development and function of osteoclasts.
        Studies of the related mouse protein indicate that it functions to protect
        against liver damage caused by chemical stressors. Mutations in this gene
        cause congenital heart defects, multiple types, 2 (CHTD2). Alternative splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2014]


        HSPB1: This gene encodes a member of the small heat shock protein (HSP20)
        family of proteins. In response to environmental stress, the encoded protein
        translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and functions as a molecular
        chaperone that promotes the correct folding of other proteins. This protein
        plays an important role in the differentiation of a wide variety of cell types.
        Expression of this gene is correlated with poor clinical outcome in multiple
        human cancers, and the encoded protein may promote cancer cell proliferation
        and metastasis, while protecting cancer cells from apoptosis. Mutations in
        this gene have been identified in human patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
        disease and distal hereditary motor neuropathy. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        IRGM: This gene encodes a member of the p47 immunity-related GTPase family.
        The encoded protein may play a role in the innate immune response by regulating
        autophagy formation in response to intracellular pathogens. Polymorphisms
        that affect the normal expression of this gene are associated with a susceptibility
        to Crohn''s disease and tuberculosis. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Oct
        2016]


        STK11: The protein encoded by this gene is a serine/threonine kinase that
        regulates cell polarity and energy metabolism and functions as a tumor suppressor.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with the autosomal dominant Peutz-Jeghers
        syndrome, as well as with skin, pancreatic, and testicular cancers. [provided
        by RefSeq, May 2022]


        CDK5R1: The protein encoded by this gene (p35) is a neuron-specific activator
        of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5); the activation of CDK5 is required for
        proper development of the central nervous system. The p35 form of this protein
        is proteolytically cleaved by calpain, generating a p25 form. The cleavage
        of p35 into p25 results in relocalization of the protein from the cell periphery
        to nuclear and perinuclear regions. P25 deregulates CDK5 activity by prolonging
        its activation and changing its cellular location. The p25 form accumulates
        in the brain neurons of patients with Alzheimer''s disease. This accumulation
        correlates with an increase in CDK5 kinase activity, and may lead to aberrantly
        phosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau, which contributes
        to Alzheimer''s disease. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

        Here are the gene summaries:



        SNCA: Alpha-synuclein is a member of the synuclein family, which also includes
        beta- and gamma-synuclein. Synucleins are abundantly expressed in the brain
        and alpha- and beta-synuclein inhibit phospholipase D2 selectively. SNCA may
        serve to integrate presynaptic signaling and membrane trafficking. Defects
        in SNCA have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. SNCA
        peptides are a major component of amyloid plaques in the brains of patients
        with Alzheimer''s disease. Alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different
        isoforms have been identified for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]


        CASP3: The protein encoded by this gene is a cysteine-aspartic acid protease
        that plays a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis. The encoded
        protein cleaves and inactivates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase while it cleaves
        and activates sterol regulatory element binding proteins as well as caspases
        6, 7, and 9. This protein itself is processed by caspases 8, 9, and 10. It
        is the predominant caspase involved in the cleavage of amyloid-beta 4A precursor
        protein, which is associated with neuronal death in Alzheimer''s disease.
        [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        TRIB3: The protein encoded by this gene is a putative protein kinase that
        is induced by the transcription factor NF-kappaB. The encoded protein is a
        negative regulator of NF-kappaB and can also sensitize cells to TNF- and TRAIL-induced
        apoptosis. In addition, this protein can negatively regulate the cell survival
        serine-threonine kinase AKT1. Differential promoter usage and alternate splicing
        result in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2014]


        CCNY: Cyclins, such as CCNY, control cell division cycles and regulate cyclin-dependent
        kinases (e.g., CDC2; MIM 116940) (Li et al., 2009 [PubMed 18060517]).[supplied
        by OMIM, May 2009]


        PIK3CA: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is composed of an 85 kDa regulatory
        subunit and a 110 kDa catalytic subunit. The protein encoded by this gene
        represents the catalytic subunit, which uses ATP to phosphorylate PtdIns,
        PtdIns4P and PtdIns(4,5)P2. This gene has been found to be oncogenic and has
        been implicated in cervical cancers. A pseudogene of this gene has been defined
        on chromosome 22. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2016]


        AKT1: This gene encodes one of the three members of the human AKT serine-threonine
        protein kinase family which are often referred to as protein kinase B alpha,
        beta, and gamma. These highly similar AKT proteins all have an N-terminal
        pleckstrin homology domain, a serine/threonine-specific kinase domain and
        a C-terminal regulatory domain. These proteins are phosphorylated by phosphoinositide
        3-kinase (PI3K). AKT/PI3K forms a key component of many signalling pathways
        that involve the binding of membrane-bound ligands such as receptor tyrosine
        kinases, G-protein coupled receptors, and integrin-linked kinase. These AKT
        proteins therefore regulate a wide variety of cellular functions including
        cell proliferation, survival, metabolism, and angiogenesis in both normal
        and malignant cells. AKT proteins are recruited to the cell membrane by phosphatidylinositol
        3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) after phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
        (PIP2) by PI3K. Subsequent phosphorylation of both threonine residue 308 and
        serine residue 473 is required for full activation of the AKT1 protein encoded
        by this gene. Phosphorylation of additional residues also occurs, for example,
        in response to insulin growth factor-1 and epidermal growth factor. Protein
        phosphatases act as negative regulators of AKT proteins by dephosphorylating
        AKT or PIP3. The PI3K/AKT signalling pathway is crucial for tumor cell survival.
        Survival factors can suppress apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner
        by activating AKT1 which then phosphorylates and inactivates components of
        the apoptotic machinery. AKT proteins also participate in the mammalian target
        of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway which controls the assembly of the
        eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4E) complex and this pathway,
        in addition to responding to extracellular signals from growth factors and
        cytokines, is disregulated in many cancers. Mutations in this gene are associated
        with multiple types of cancer and excessive tissue growth including Proteus
        syndrome and Cowden syndrome 6, and breast, colorectal, and ovarian cancers.
        Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this
        gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2020]


        NOD2: This gene is a member of the Nod1/Apaf-1 family and encodes a protein
        with two caspase recruitment (CARD) domains and six leucine-rich repeats (LRRs).
        The protein is primarily expressed in the peripheral blood leukocytes. It
        plays a role in the immune response to intracellular bacterial lipopolysaccharides
        (LPS) by recognizing the muramyl dipeptide (MDP) derived from them and activating
        the NFKB protein. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Crohn disease
        and Blau syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct
        isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2014]


        KAT5: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the MYST family of histone
        acetyl transferases (HATs) and was originally isolated as an HIV-1 TAT-interactive
        protein. HATs play important roles in regulating chromatin remodeling, transcription
        and other nuclear processes by acetylating histone and nonhistone proteins.
        This protein is a histone acetylase that has a role in DNA repair and apoptosis
        and is thought to play an important role in signal transduction. Alternative
        splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by
        RefSeq, Jul 2008]


        RPTOR: This gene encodes a component of a signaling pathway that regulates
        cell growth in response to nutrient and insulin levels. The encoded protein
        forms a stoichiometric complex with the mTOR kinase, and also associates with
        eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 and ribosomal protein S6
        kinase. The protein positively regulates the downstream effector ribosomal
        protein S6 kinase, and negatively regulates the mTOR kinase. Multiple transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided
        by RefSeq, Sep 2009]


        SMCR8: Enables protein kinase binding activity and protein kinase inhibitor
        activity. Contributes to guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity. Involved
        in negative regulation of macromolecule metabolic process; regulation of TOR
        signaling; and regulation of macroautophagy. Located in chromatin; cytoplasm;
        and nucleoplasm. Part of guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor complex. Colocalizes
        with Atg1/ULK1 kinase complex. [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources,
        Apr 2022]


        MLST8: Enables protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity. Involved
        in TORC1 signaling; positive regulation of TOR signaling; and regulation of
        actin cytoskeleton organization. Part of TORC1 complex and TORC2 complex.
        [provided by Alliance of Genome Resources, Apr 2022]


        TAB2: The protein encoded by this gene is an activator of MAP3K7/TAK1, which
        is required for for the IL-1 induced activation of nuclear factor kappaB and
        MAPK8/JNK. This protein forms a kinase complex with TRAF6, MAP3K7 and TAB1,
        and it thus serves as an adaptor that links MAP3K7 and TRAF6. This protein,
        along with TAB1 and MAP3K7, also participates in the signal transduction induced
        by TNFSF11/RANKl through the activation of the receptor activator of NF-kappaB
        (TNFRSF11A/RANK), which may regulate the development and function of osteoclasts.
        Studies of the related mouse protein indicate that it functions to protect
        against liver damage caused by chemical stressors. Mutations in this gene
        cause congenital heart defects, multiple types, 2 (CHTD2). Alternative splicing
        results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2014]


        HSPB1: This gene encodes a member of the small heat shock protein (HSP20)
        family of proteins. In response to environmental stress, the encoded protein
        translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and functions as a molecular
        chaperone that promotes the correct folding of other proteins. This protein
        plays an important role in the differentiation of a wide variety of cell types.
        Expression of this gene is correlated with poor clinical outcome in multiple
        human cancers, and the encoded protein may promote cancer cell proliferation
        and metastasis, while protecting cancer cells from apoptosis. Mutations in
        this gene have been identified in human patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
        disease and distal hereditary motor neuropathy. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]


        IRGM: This gene encodes a member of the p47 immunity-related GTPase family.
        The encoded protein may play a role in the innate immune response by regulating
        autophagy formation in response to intracellular pathogens. Polymorphisms
        that affect the normal expression of this gene are associated with a susceptibility
        to Crohn''s disease and tuberculosis. Alternative splicing results in multiple
        transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Oct
        2016]


        STK11: The protein encoded by this gene is a serine/threonine kinase that
        regulates cell polarity and energy metabolism and functions as a tumor suppressor.
        Mutations in this gene have been associated with the autosomal dominant Peutz-Jeghers
        syndrome, as well as with skin, pancreatic, and testicular cancers. [provided
        by RefSeq, May 2022]


        CDK5R1: The protein encoded by this gene (p35) is a neuron-specific activator
        of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5); the activation of CDK5 is required for
        proper development of the central nervous system. The p35 form of this protein
        is proteolytically cleaved by calpain, generating a p25 form. The cleavage
        of p35 into p25 results in relocalization of the protein from the cell periphery
        to nuclear and perinuclear regions. P25 deregulates CDK5 activity by prolonging
        its activation and changing its cellular location. The p25 form accumulates
        in the brain neurons of patients with Alzheimer''s disease. This accumulation
        correlates with an increase in CDK5 kinase activity, and may lead to aberrantly
        phosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau, which contributes
        to Alzheimer''s disease. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
