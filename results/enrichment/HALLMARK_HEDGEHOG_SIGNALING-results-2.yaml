        ACHE: Acetylcholinesterase hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine
        at neuromuscular junctions and brain cholinergic synapses, and thus terminates
        signal transmission. It is also found on the red blood cell membranes, where
        it constitutes the Yt blood group antigen. Acetylcholinesterase exists in
        multiple molecular forms which possess similar catalytic properties, but differ
        in their oligomeric assembly and mode of cell attachment to the cell surface.
        It is encoded by the single ACHE gene, and the structural diversity in the
        gene products arises from alternative mRNA splicing, and post-translational
        associations of catalytic and structural subunits. The major form of acetylcholinesterase
        found in brain, muscle and other tissues is the hydrophilic species, which
        forms disulfide-linked oligomers with collagenous, or lipid-containing stru...

        the inhibitory effect of angiostatin on tube formation and the migratio...


        CDK5R1: The protein encoded by this gene (p35) is a neuron-specific activator
        of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5); the activation of CDK5 is required for
        proper development of the central nervous system. The p35 form of this protein
        is proteolytically cleaved by calpain, generating a p25 form. The cleavage
        of p35 into p25 results in relocalization of the protein from the cell periphery
        to nuclear and perinuclear regions. P25 deregulates CDK5 activity by prolonging
        its activation and changing its cellular location. The p25 form accumu...


        CDK6: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the CMGC family of serine/threonine
        protein kinases. This kinase is a catalytic subunit of the protein kinase
        complex that is important for cell cycle G1 phase progression and G1/S transition.
        The activity of this kinase first appears in mid-G1 phase, which is controlled
        by the regulatory subunits including D-type cyclins and members of INK4 family
        of CDK inhibitors. This kinase, as well as CDK4, has been shown to phosphorylate,
        and thus regulate the activity of, tumor sup...

        part of the cadherin superfamily. The flamingo subfamily consists of nonclassic-type
        cadherins; a subpopulation that does not interact with catenins. The flamingo
        cadherins are located at the plasma membrane and have nine cadherin domains,
        seven epidermal growth factor-like repeats and two laminin A G-type repeats
        in their ectodomain. They also have seven transmembrane domains, a characteristic
        unique to this subfamily. It is postulated that these proteins are receptors
        involved in contact-mediate...


        CNTFR: This gene encodes a member of the type 1 cytokine receptor family.
        The encoded protein is the ligand-specific component of a tripartite receptor
        for ciliary neurotrophic factor, which plays a critical role in neuronal cell
        survival, differentiation and gene expression. Binding of ciliary neurotrophic
        factor to the encoded protein recruits the transmembrane components of the
        receptor, gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, facilitating signal
        tran...


        CRMP1: This gene encodes a member of a family of cytosolic phosphoproteins
        expressed exclusively in the nervous system. The encoded protein is thought
        to be a part of the semaphorin signal transduction pathway implicated in semaphorin-induced
        grow...


        DPYSL2: This gene encodes a member of the collapsin response mediator protein
        family. Collapsin response mediator proteins form homo- and hetero-tetramers
        and facilitate neuron guidance, growth and polarity. The encoded protein promotes
        microtubule assembly and is required for Sema3A-mediated growth cone collapse,
        and also plays a role in synaptic signaling through interactions with calcium
        channels. This gene has been implicated in multiple neurological ...


        ETS2: This gene encodes a transcription factor which regulates genes involved
        in development and apoptosis. The encoded protein is also a protooncogene

        The encoded transcription factor is activated by the sonic hedgehog signal
        transduction cascade and regulates stem cell proliferation. The activity and
        nuclear localization of this protein is negatively r...


        HEY1: This gene encodes a nuclear protein belonging to the hairy and enhancer
        of split-related (HESR) family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type transcriptional
        repressors. Expression of this gene is induced by the Notch and c-Jun signal
        transduction pathways. Two similar and redundant genes in mouse are required
        for embryon...


        HEY2: This gene encodes a member of the hairy and enhancer of split-related
        (HESR) family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type transcription factors.
        The encoded protein forms homo- or hetero-dimers that localize to the nucleus
        and interact with a histone deacetylase complex to repress transcription.
        Expression of this gene is induced by the Notch signal transduction pathway.
        Two similar and redundant genes in mouse are required fo...


        L1CAM: The protein encoded by this gene is an axonal glycoprotein belonging
        to the immunoglobulin supergene family. The ectodomain, consisting of several
        immunoglobulin-like domains and fibronectin-like repeats (type III), is linked
        via a single transmembrane sequence to a conserved cytoplasmic domain. This
        cell adhesion molecule plays an important role in nervous system development,
        including neuronal migration and differentiation. Mutations in the gene cause
        X-linked neurological syndromes known as CRAS...


        LDB1: Enables LIM domain binding activity; RNA polymerase II-specific DNA-binding
        transcription factor binding activity; and enzyme binding activity. Involved
        in negative regulation of transcription, DNA-templated and positive regulation
        of transcr...


        MYH9: This gene encodes a conventional non-muscle myosin; this protein should
        not be confused with the unconventional myosin-9a or 9b (MYO9A or MYO9B).
        The encoded protein is a myosin IIA heavy chain that contains an IQ domain
        and a myosin head-like domain which is involved in several important functions,
        including cytokinesis, cell motility and maintenance of cell shape. Defects
        in this gene have been associated with non-syndromic sen...


        NF1: This gene product appears to function as a negative regulator of the
        ras signal transduction pathway. Mutations in this gene have been linked to
        neurofibromatosis type 1, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and Watson syndrome.
        The mRNA for this gene is subject to RNA editing (CGA>UGA->Arg1306Term) resulting
        in ...


        NKX6-1: In the pancreas, NKX6.1 is required for the development of beta cells
        and is a potent bifunctional transcription regulator that binds to AT-rich
        sequences within the pr...


        NRCAM: Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily.
        This gene encodes a neuronal cell adhesion molecule with multiple immunoglobulin-like
        C2-type domains and fibronectin type-III domains. This ankyrin-binding protein
        is involved in neuron-neuron adhesion and promotes directional signaling during
        axonal cone growth. This gene is also expressed in non-neural tissues and
        may play a general role in cell-cell communication via signaling from its
        intracellular doma...


        NRP1: This gene encodes one of two neuropilins, which contain specific protein
        domains which allow them to participate in several different types of signaling
        pathways that control cell migration. Neuropilins contain a large N-terminal
        extracellular domain, made up of complement-binding, coagulation factor V/VIII,
        and meprin domains. These proteins also contains a short membrane-spanning
        domain and a small cytoplasmic domain. Neuropilins bind many ligands and various
        types of co-receptors; they affect cell survival, migration, and ...


        NRP2: This gene encodes a member of the neuropilin family of receptor proteins.
        The encoded transmembrane protein binds to SEMA3C protein {sema domain, immunoglobulin
        domain (Ig), short basic domain, secreted, (semaphorin) 3C} and SEMA3F protein
        {sema domain, immunoglobulin domain (Ig), short basic domain, secreted, (semaphorin)
        3F}, and interacts with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This protein
        may...


        OPHN1: This gene encodes a Rho-GTPase-activating protein that promotes GTP
        hydrolysis of Rho subfamily members. Rho proteins are important mediators
        of intracellular signal transduction, which affects cell migration and cell
        morphogenesis. Mutations in this gene are resp...


        PLG: The plasminogen protein encoded by this gene is a serine protease that
        circulates in blood plasma as an inactive zymogen and is converted to the
        active protease, plasmin, by several plasminogen activators such as tissue
        plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), kallikrein,
        and factor XII (Hageman factor). The conversion of plasminogen to plasmin
        involves the cleavage of the peptide bond between Arg-561 and Val-562. Plasmin
        cleavage also releases the angiostatin protein which inhibits angiogenesis.
        Plasmin degrades many blood plasma proteins, including fibrin-containing blood
        clots. As a serine protease, plasmin cleaves many products in addition to
        fibrin such as fibronectin, thrombospondin, laminin, and von Willebrand factor.
        Plasmin is inactivated by proteins such as alpha-2-macroglobulin and alpha-2-antiplasmin
        in addition to inhibitors of the various plasminogen activators. Plasminogen
        also interacts with plasminogen receptors which results in the retention of
        plasmin on cell surfaces and in plasmin-induced cell...


        PML: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tripartite motif
        (TRIM) family. The TRIM motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a RING,
        a B-box type 1 and a B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region. This phosphoprotein
        localizes to nuclear bodies where it functions as a transcription factor and
        tumor suppressor. Its expression is cell-cycle related and it regulates the
        p53 response to oncogenic signals. The gene is often involved in the translocation
        with the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene associated with acute promyelocyti...


        PTCH1: This gene encodes a member of the patched family of proteins and a
        component of the hedgehog signaling pathway. Hedgehog signaling is important
        in embryonic development and tumorigenesis. The encoded protein is the receptor
        for the secreted hedgehog ligands, which include sonic hedgehog, indian hedgehog
        and desert hedgehog. Following binding by one of the hedgehog ligands, the
        encoded protein is trafficked away from the primary cilium, ...


        RASA1: The protein encoded by this gene is located in the cytoplasm and is
        part of the GAP1 family of GTPase-activating proteins. The gene product stimulates
        the GTPase activity of normal RAS p21 but not its oncogenic counterpart. Acting
        as a suppressor of RAS function, the protein enhances the weak intrinsic GTPase
        activity of RAS proteins resulting in the inactive GDP-bound form of RAS,
        thereby allowing control of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Mutations
        leading to changes in the binding sites of either protein are associated with
        basal cell carcinomas. Mutations also have been associated with hereditary
        cap...


        RTN1: This gene belongs to the family of reticulon encoding genes. Reticulons
        are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, and are involved in neuroendocrine
        secretion or in membrane trafficking in neuroendocrine cells. This gene is
        considered to be a specific marker for neurological di...


        SCG2: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the chromogranin/secretogranin
        family of neuroendocrine secretory proteins. Studies in rodents suggest that
        the full-length protein, secretogranin II, is involved in the packaging or
        sorting of peptide hormones and neuropeptides into secretory vesicles. The
        full-length prote...


        SHH: This gene encodes a protein that is instrumental in patterning the early
        embryo. It has been implicated as the key inductive signal in patterning of
        the ventral neural tube, the anterior-posterior limb axis, and the ventral
        somites. Of three human proteins showing sequence and functional similarity
        to the sonic hedgehog protein of Drosophila, this protein is the most similar.
        The protein is made as a precursor that is autocatalytically cleaved; the
        N-terminal portion is soluble and contains the signalling activity while the
        C-terminal portion is involved in precursor processing. More importantly,
        the C-terminal product covalently attaches a cholesterol moiety to the N-terminal
        product, restricting the N-terminal product to the cell surface and preventing
        it from freely diffusing throughout the developing embryo. Defects in this
        protein or in its signalling pathway are a cause of holoprosencephaly (HPE),
        a disorder in which the developing forebrain fails to correctly separate into
        rig...


        SLIT1: Enables Roundabout binding activity. Involved in axon extension involved
        in axon guidance; motor neuron axon guidance; and negative chemotaxis. Predicted
        to be located in extracellular r...


        THY1: This gene encodes a cell surface glycoprotein and member of the immunoglobulin
        superfamily of proteins. The encoded protein is involved in cell adhesion
        and cell communication in numerous cell types, but particularly in cells of
        the immune and nervous systems. The encoded protein is widely used as a marker
        for hematopoie...


        TLE1: Enables identical protein binding activity and transcription corepressor
        activity. Involved in negative regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling;
        negative regulation of anoikis; and regulation of gene expression...


        TLE3: This gene encodes a transcriptional co-repressor protein that belongs
        to the transducin-like enhancer family of proteins. The members of this family
        function in the Notch signaling pathway that regulates determination of cell
        fate during development. Expression of this gene has been associated with
        a favorable outcome to chemotherapy with taxanes for ovarian carcinoma. Altern...


        UNC5C: This gene product belongs to the UNC-5 family of netrin receptors.
        Netrins are secreted proteins that direct axon extension and cell migration
        during neural development. They are bifunctional proteins that act as attractants
        for some cell types and as repellents for others, and these opposite actions
        are thought to be mediated by two classes of receptors. The UNC-5 family of
        recepto...


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expr...


        VLDLR: The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family consists of
        cell surface proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific
        ligands. This gene encodes a lipoprotein receptor that is a member of the
        LDLR family and plays important roles in VLDL-triglyceride metabolism and
        the reelin signaling pathway. Mutations in...

        transcription factor binding activity; and enzyme binding activity. Involved
        in negative regulation of transcription, DNA-templated and positive regulation
        of transcr...


        MYH9: This gene encodes a conventional non-muscle myosin; this protein should
        not be confused with the unconventional myosin-9a or 9b (MYO9A or MYO9B).
        The encoded protein is a myosin IIA heavy chain that contains an IQ domain
        and a myosin head-like domain which is involved in several important functions,
        including cytokinesis, cell motility and maintenance of cell shape. Defects
        in this gene have been associated with non-syndromic sen...


        NF1: This gene product appears to function as a negative regulator of the
        ras signal transduction pathway. Mutations in this gene have been linked to
        neurofibromatosis type 1, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and Watson syndrome.
        The mRNA for this gene is subject to RNA editing (CGA>UGA->Arg1306Term) resulting
        in ...


        NKX6-1: In the pancreas, NKX6.1 is required for the development of beta cells
        and is a potent bifunctional transcription regulator that binds to AT-rich
        sequences within the pr...


        NRCAM: Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily.
        This gene encodes a neuronal cell adhesion molecule with multiple immunoglobulin-like
        C2-type domains and fibronectin type-III domains. This ankyrin-binding protein
        is involved in neuron-neuron adhesion and promotes directional signaling during
        axonal cone growth. This gene is also expressed in non-neural tissues and
        may play a general role in cell-cell communication via signaling from its
        intracellular doma...


        NRP1: This gene encodes one of two neuropilins, which contain specific protein
        domains which allow them to participate in several different types of signaling
        pathways that control cell migration. Neuropilins contain a large N-terminal
        extracellular domain, made up of complement-binding, coagulation factor V/VIII,
        and meprin domains. These proteins also contains a short membrane-spanning
        domain and a small cytoplasmic domain. Neuropilins bind many ligands and various
        types of co-receptors; they affect cell survival, migration, and ...


        NRP2: This gene encodes a member of the neuropilin family of receptor proteins.
        The encoded transmembrane protein binds to SEMA3C protein {sema domain, immunoglobulin
        domain (Ig), short basic domain, secreted, (semaphorin) 3C} and SEMA3F protein
        {sema domain, immunoglobulin domain (Ig), short basic domain, secreted, (semaphorin)
        3F}, and interacts with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This protein
        may...


        OPHN1: This gene encodes a Rho-GTPase-activating protein that promotes GTP
        hydrolysis of Rho subfamily members. Rho proteins are important mediators
        of intracellular signal transduction, which affects cell migration and cell
        morphogenesis. Mutations in this gene are resp...


        PLG: The plasminogen protein encoded by this gene is a serine protease that
        circulates in blood plasma as an inactive zymogen and is converted to the
        active protease, plasmin, by several plasminogen activators such as tissue
        plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), kallikrein,
        and factor XII (Hageman factor). The conversion of plasminogen to plasmin
        involves the cleavage of the peptide bond between Arg-561 and Val-562. Plasmin
        cleavage also releases the angiostatin protein which inhibits angiogenesis.
        Plasmin degrades many blood plasma proteins, including fibrin-containing blood
        clots. As a serine protease, plasmin cleaves many products in addition to
        fibrin such as fibronectin, thrombospondin, laminin, and von Willebrand factor.
        Plasmin is inactivated by proteins such as alpha-2-macroglobulin and alpha-2-antiplasmin
        in addition to inhibitors of the various plasminogen activators. Plasminogen
        also interacts with plasminogen receptors which results in the retention of
        plasmin on cell surfaces and in plasmin-induced cell...


        PML: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tripartite motif
        (TRIM) family. The TRIM motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a RING,
        a B-box type 1 and a B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region. This phosphoprotein
        localizes to nuclear bodies where it functions as a transcription factor and
        tumor suppressor. Its expression is cell-cycle related and it regulates the
        p53 response to oncogenic signals. The gene is often involved in the translocation
        with the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene associated with acute promyelocyti...


        PTCH1: This gene encodes a member of the patched family of proteins and a
        component of the hedgehog signaling pathway. Hedgehog signaling is important
        in embryonic development and tumorigenesis. The encoded protein is the receptor
        for the secreted hedgehog ligands, which include sonic hedgehog, indian hedgehog
        and desert hedgehog. Following binding by one of the hedgehog ligands, the
        encoded protein is trafficked away from the primary cilium, ...


        RASA1: The protein encoded by this gene is located in the cytoplasm and is
        part of the GAP1 family of GTPase-activating proteins. The gene product stimulates
        the GTPase activity of normal RAS p21 but not its oncogenic counterpart. Acting
        as a suppressor of RAS function, the protein enhances the weak intrinsic GTPase
        activity of RAS proteins resulting in the inactive GDP-bound form of RAS,
        thereby allowing control of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Mutations
        leading to changes in the binding sites of either protein are associated with
        basal cell carcinomas. Mutations also have been associated with hereditary
        cap...


        RTN1: This gene belongs to the family of reticulon encoding genes. Reticulons
        are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, and are involved in neuroendocrine
        secretion or in membrane trafficking in neuroendocrine cells. This gene is
        considered to be a specific marker for neurological di...


        SCG2: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the chromogranin/secretogranin
        family of neuroendocrine secretory proteins. Studies in rodents suggest that
        the full-length protein, secretogranin II, is involved in the packaging or
        sorting of peptide hormones and neuropeptides into secretory vesicles. The
        full-length prote...


        SHH: This gene encodes a protein that is instrumental in patterning the early
        embryo. It has been implicated as the key inductive signal in patterning of
        the ventral neural tube, the anterior-posterior limb axis, and the ventral
        somites. Of three human proteins showing sequence and functional similarity
        to the sonic hedgehog protein of Drosophila, this protein is the most similar.
        The protein is made as a precursor that is autocatalytically cleaved; the
        N-terminal portion is soluble and contains the signalling activity while the
        C-terminal portion is involved in precursor processing. More importantly,
        the C-terminal product covalently attaches a cholesterol moiety to the N-terminal
        product, restricting the N-terminal product to the cell surface and preventing
        it from freely diffusing throughout the developing embryo. Defects in this
        protein or in its signalling pathway are a cause of holoprosencephaly (HPE),
        a disorder in which the developing forebrain fails to correctly separate into
        rig...


        SLIT1: Enables Roundabout binding activity. Involved in axon extension involved
        in axon guidance; motor neuron axon guidance; and negative chemotaxis. Predicted
        to be located in extracellular r...


        THY1: This gene encodes a cell surface glycoprotein and member of the immunoglobulin
        superfamily of proteins. The encoded protein is involved in cell adhesion
        and cell communication in numerous cell types, but particularly in cells of
        the immune and nervous systems. The encoded protein is widely used as a marker
        for hematopoie...


        TLE1: Enables identical protein binding activity and transcription corepressor
        activity. Involved in negative regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling;
        negative regulation of anoikis; and regulation of gene expression...


        TLE3: This gene encodes a transcriptional co-repressor protein that belongs
        to the transducin-like enhancer family of proteins. The members of this family
        function in the Notch signaling pathway that regulates determination of cell
        fate during development. Expression of this gene has been associated with
        a favorable outcome to chemotherapy with taxanes for ovarian carcinoma. Altern...


        UNC5C: This gene product belongs to the UNC-5 family of netrin receptors.
        Netrins are secreted proteins that direct axon extension and cell migration
        during neural development. They are bifunctional proteins that act as attractants
        for some cell types and as repellents for others, and these opposite actions
        are thought to be mediated by two classes of receptors. The UNC-5 family of
        recepto...


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expr...


        VLDLR: The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family consists of
        cell surface proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific
        ligands. This gene encodes a lipoprotein receptor that is a member of the
        LDLR family and plays important roles in VLDL-triglyceride metabolism and
        the reelin signaling pathway. Mutations in...

        ACHE: Acetylcholinesterase hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine
        at neuromuscular junctions and brain cholinergic synapses, and thus terminates
        signal transmission. It is also found on the red blood cell membranes, where
        it constitutes the Yt blood group antigen. Acetylcholinesterase exists in
        multiple molecular forms which possess similar catalytic properties, but differ
        in their oligomeric assembly and mode of cell attachment to the cell surface.
        It is encoded by the single ACHE gene, and the structural diversity in the
        gene products arises from alternative mRNA splicing, and post-translational
        associations of catalytic and structural subunits. The major form of a...

        of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5); the activation of CDK5 is required for
        proper development of the central nervous system. The p35 form of this protein
        is proteolytically cleaved by calpain, generating a p25 form. The cleavage
        of p35 into p25 results in relocalization of the protein from the cell periphery
        to nuclear and perinuclear regions. P25 der...


        CDK6: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the CMGC family of serine/threonine
        protein kinases. This kinase is a catalytic subunit of the protein kinase

        C2-type domains and fibronectin type-III domains. This ankyrin-binding protein
        is involved in neuron-neuron adhesion and promotes directional signaling during
        axonal cone growth. This gene is also expressed in non-neural tissue...


        NRP1: This gene encodes one of two neuropilins, which contain specific protein
        domains which allow them to participate in several different types of signaling
        pathways that control cell migration. Neuropilins contain a large N-terminal
        extracellular domain, made up of complement-binding, coagulation factor V/VIII,
        and meprin domains. These proteins also contains a short membrane-spanning
        domain and a small cytoplasmic domain. N...


        NRP2: This gene encodes a member of the neuropilin family of receptor proteins.

        hydrolysis of Rho subfamily members. Rho proteins are important mediators
        of intracellular signal transduction, which affects cell migration an...


        PLG: The plasminogen protein encoded by this gene is a serine protease that
        circulates in blood plasma as an inactive zymogen and is converted to the
        active protease, plasmin, by several plasminogen activators such as tissue
        plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), kallikrein,
        and factor XII (Hageman factor). The conversion of plasminogen to plasmin
        involves the cleavage of the peptide bond between Arg-561 and Val-562. Plasmin
        cleavage also releases the angiostatin protein which inhibits angiogenesis.
        Plasmin degrades many blood plasma proteins, including fibrin-containing blood
        clots. As a serine protease, plasmin cleaves many products in addition to
        fibrin such as fibronectin, thrombospondin, laminin, and von Willebrand factor.
        Plasmin is inactivated by proteins such as alpha-2-macroglobulin and alpha-2-antipl...


        PML: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tripartite motif
        (TRIM) family. The TRIM motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a RING,
        a B-box type 1 and a B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region. This phosphoprotein
        localizes to nuclear bodies where it functions as a transcription factor and
        tumor suppressor. Its expression is cell-cycle related and it regulates the
        p53 response to oncogenic signals. The gene is often ...


        PTCH1: This gene encodes a member of the patched family of proteins and a
        component of the hedgehog signaling pathway. Hedgehog signaling is important
        in embryonic development and tumorigenesis. The encoded protein is the receptor
        for the secreted hedgehog ligands, which include sonic hedgehog, indian hedgehog
        and desert hedgehog. Following binding by one o...


        RASA1: The protein encoded by this gene is located in the cytoplasm and is
        part of the GAP1 family of GTPase-activating proteins. The gene product stimulates
        the GTPase activity of normal RAS p21 but not its oncogenic counterpart. Acting
        as a suppressor of RAS function, the protein enhances the weak intrinsic GTPase
        activity of RAS proteins resulting in the inactive GDP-bound form of RAS,
        thereby allowing control of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Mutations
        leading to changes in the bindi...


        RTN1: This gene belongs to the family of reticulon encoding genes. Reticulons
        are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, and are involved in neuroendocrine
        secretion or in membrane trafficking in neuroendocrine cells. This gene ...


        SCG2: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the chromogranin/secretogranin
        family of neuroendocrine secretory proteins. Studies in rodents suggest that
        the full-length protein, secretogranin II, is involved in the packaging or
        sorting of peptide hormones...


        SHH: This gene encodes a protein that is instrumental in patterning the early
        embryo. It has been implicated as the key inductive signal in patterning of
        the ventral neural tube, the anterior-posterior limb axis, and the ventral
        somites. Of three human proteins showing sequence and functional similarity
        to the sonic hedgehog protein of Drosophila, this protein is the most similar.
        The protein is made as a precursor that is autocatalytically cleaved; the
        N-terminal portion is soluble and contains the signalling activity while the
        C-terminal portion is involved in precursor processing. More importantly,
        the C-terminal product covalently attaches a cholesterol moiety to the N-terminal
        product, restricting the N-terminal product to the cell surface and preventing
        it from freely diffusing througho...


        SLIT1: Enables Roundabout binding activity. Involved in axon extension involved
        in axon guidance; motor neuron axon guidance; and negative chemotaxis. Predi...

        activity. Involved in negative regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling;
        negative regulation o...


        TLE3: This gene encodes a transcriptional co-repressor protein that belongs
        to the transducin-like enhancer family of proteins. The members of this family
        function in the Notch signaling pathway that regulates determination of cell
        fate during development. Expression of this gene has been associated with
        a f...


        UNC5C: This gene product belongs to the UNC-5 family of netrin receptors.
        Netrins are secreted proteins that direct axon extension and cell migration
        during neural development. They are bifunctional proteins that act as attractants
        for some cell types and as repellents for others, and these opposite actions
        are th...


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in addit...

        ACHE: Acetylcholinesterase hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine
        at neuromuscular junctions and brain cholinergic synapses, and thus terminates
        signal transmission. It is also found on the red blood cell membranes, where
        it constitutes the Yt blood group antigen. Acetylcholinesterase exists in
        multiple molecular forms which possess similar catalytic properties, but differ
        in their oligomeric assembly and mode of cell attachment to the cell surface.
        It is encoded by the single ACHE gene, and the structural diversity in the
        gene products arises from alternative mRNA splicing, and post-translational
        associations of catalytic and structural subunits. The major form of a...

        of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5); the activation of CDK5 is required for
        proper development of the central nervous system. The p35 form of this protein
        is proteolytically cleaved by calpain, generating a p25 form. The cleavage
        of p35 into p25 results in relocalization of the protein from the cell periphery
        to nuclear and perinuclear regions. P25 der...


        CDK6: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the CMGC family of serine/threonine
        protein kinases. This kinase is a catalytic subunit of the protein kinase

        C2-type domains and fibronectin type-III domains. This ankyrin-binding protein
        is involved in neuron-neuron adhesion and promotes directional signaling during
        axonal cone growth. This gene is also expressed in non-neural tissue...


        NRP1: This gene encodes one of two neuropilins, which contain specific protein
        domains which allow them to participate in several different types of signaling
        pathways that control cell migration. Neuropilins contain a large N-terminal
        extracellular domain, made up of complement-binding, coagulation factor V/VIII,
        and meprin domains. These proteins also contains a short membrane-spanning
        domain and a small cytoplasmic domain. N...


        NRP2: This gene encodes a member of the neuropilin family of receptor proteins.

        OPHN1: This gene encodes a Rho-GTPase-activating protein that promotes GTP
        hydrolysis of Rho subfamily members. Rho proteins are important mediators
        of intracellular signal transduction, which affects cell migration an...


        PLG: The plasminogen protein encoded by this gene is a serine protease that
        circulates in blood plasma as an inactive zymogen and is converted to the
        active protease, plasmin, by several plasminogen activators such as tissue
        plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), kallikrein,
        and factor XII (Hageman factor). The conversion of plasminogen to plasmin
        involves the cleavage of the peptide bond between Arg-561 and Val-562. Plasmin
        cleavage also releases the angiostatin protein which inhibits angiogenesis.
        Plasmin degrades many blood plasma proteins, including fibrin-containing blood
        clots. As a serine protease, plasmin cleaves many products in addition to
        fibrin such as fibronectin, thrombospondin, laminin, and von Willebrand factor.
        Plasmin is inactivated by proteins such as alpha-2-macroglobulin and alpha-2-antipl...


        PML: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tripartite motif
        (TRIM) family. The TRIM motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a RING,
        a B-box type 1 and a B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region. This phosphoprotein
        localizes to nuclear bodies where it functions as a transcription factor and
        tumor suppressor. Its expression is cell-cycle related and it regulates the
        p53 response to oncogenic signals. The gene is often ...


        PTCH1: This gene encodes a member of the patched family of proteins and a
        component of the hedgehog signaling pathway. Hedgehog signaling is important
        in embryonic development and tumorigenesis. The encoded protein is the receptor
        for the secreted hedgehog ligands, which include sonic hedgehog, indian hedgehog
        and desert hedgehog. Following binding by one o...


        RASA1: The protein encoded by this gene is located in the cytoplasm and is
        part of the GAP1 family of GTPase-activating proteins. The gene product stimulates
        the GTPase activity of normal RAS p21 but not its oncogenic counterpart. Acting
        as a suppressor of RAS function, the protein enhances the weak intrinsic GTPase
        activity of RAS proteins resulting in the inactive GDP-bound form of RAS,
        thereby allowing control of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Mutations
        leading to changes in the bindi...


        RTN1: This gene belongs to the family of reticulon encoding genes. Reticulons
        are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, and are involved in neuroendocrine
        secretion or in membrane trafficking in neuroendocrine cells. This gene ...


        SCG2: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the chromogranin/secretogranin
        family of neuroendocrine secretory proteins. Studies in rodents suggest that
        the full-length protein, secretogranin II, is involved in the packaging or
        sorting of peptide hormones...


        SHH: This gene encodes a protein that is instrumental in patterning the early
        embryo. It has been implicated as the key inductive signal in patterning of
        the ventral neural tube, the anterior-posterior limb axis, and the ventral
        somites. Of three human proteins showing sequence and functional similarity
        to the sonic hedgehog protein of Drosophila, this protein is the most similar.
        The protein is made as a precursor that is autocatalytically cleaved; the
        N-terminal portion is soluble and contains the signalling activity while the
        C-terminal portion is involved in precursor processing. More importantly,
        the C-terminal product covalently attaches a cholesterol moiety to the N-terminal
        product, restricting the N-terminal product to the cell surface and preventing
        it from freely diffusing througho...


        SLIT1: Enables Roundabout binding activity. Involved in axon extension involved
        in axon guidance; motor neuron axon guidance; and negative chemotaxis. Predi...

        activity. Involved in negative regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling;
        negative regulation o...


        TLE3: This gene encodes a transcriptional co-repressor protein that belongs
        to the transducin-like enhancer family of proteins. The members of this family
        function in the Notch signaling pathway that regulates determination of cell
        fate during development. Expression of this gene has been associated with
        a f...


        UNC5C: This gene product belongs to the UNC-5 family of netrin receptors.
        Netrins are secreted proteins that direct axon extension and cell migration
        during neural development. They are bifunctional proteins that act as attractants
        for some cell types and as repellents for others, and these opposite actions
        are th...


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in addit...

        ACHE: Enables several functions, including acetylcholine binding activity;
        acetylcholinesterase activity; and protein homodimerization activity. Involved
        in acetylcholine catabolic process; cell adhesion; and osteoblast development.
        Located in several cellular components, including Golgi apparatus; perinuclear
        region of cytoplasm; and synapse. Implicated in Alzheimer''s disease; epilepsy;
        and myasthenia gravis. Biomarker of Hirschsprung''s disease; autoimmune disease
        (multiple); bacterial meningitis; and neurodegenerative disease (multiple).


        HEY2: Enables several functions, including DNA-binding transcription factor
        activity, RNA polymerase II-specific; RNA polymerase II-specific DNA-binding
        transcription factor binding activity; and histone deacetylase binding activity.
        Involved in negative regulation of transcription initiation by RNA polymerase
        II; negative regulation of transcription regulatory region DNA binding activity;
        and vascular associated smooth muscle cell development. Part of transcription
        repressor complex.

        Here are the gene summaries:



        ACHE: Acetylcholinesterase hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine
        at neuromuscular junctions and brain cholinergic synapses, and thus terminates
        signal transmission. It is also found on the red blood cell membranes, where
        it constitutes the Yt blood group antigen. Acetylcholinesterase exists in
        multiple molecular forms which possess similar catalytic properties, but differ
        in their oligomeric assembly and mode of cell attachment to the cell surface.
        It is encoded by the single ACHE gene, and the structural diversity in the
        gene products arises from alternative mRNA splicing, and post-translational
        associations of catalytic and structural subunits. The major form of acetylcholinesterase
        found in brain, muscle and other tissues is the hydrophilic species, which
        forms disulfide-linked oligomers with collagenous, or lipid-containing stru...


        HEY2: This gene encodes a member of the hairy and enhancer of split-related
        (HESR) family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type transcription factors.
        The encoded protein forms homo- or hetero-dimers that localize to the nucleus
        and interact with a histone deacetylase complex to repress transcription.
        Expression of this gene is induced by the Notch signal transduction pathway.
        Two similar and redundant genes in mouse are required fo...


        THY1: This gene encodes a cell surface glycoprotein and member of the immunoglobulin
        superfamily of proteins. The encoded protein is involved in cell adhesion
        and cell communication in numerous cell types, but particularly in cells of
        the immune and nervous systems. The encoded protein is widely used as a marker
        for hematopoie...


        PTCH1: This gene encodes a member of the patched family of proteins and a
        component of the hedgehog signaling pathway. Hedgehog signaling is important
        in embryonic development and tumorigenesis. The encoded protein is the receptor
        for the secreted hedgehog ligands, which include sonic hedgehog, indian hedgehog
        and desert hedgehog. Following binding by one of the hedgehog ligands, the
        encoded protein is trafficked away from the primary cilium, ...


        UNC5C: This gene product belongs to the UNC-5 family of netrin receptors.
        Netrins are secreted proteins that direct axon extension and cell migration
        during neural development. They are bifunctional proteins that act as attractants
        for some cell types and as repellents for others, and these opposite actions
        are thought to be mediated by two classes of receptors. The UNC-5 family of
        recepto...


        NKX6-1: In the pancreas, NKX6.1 is required for the development of beta cells
        and is a potent bifunctional transcription regulator that binds to AT-rich
        sequences within the pr...


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expr...


        NRP1: This gene encodes one of two neuropilins, which contain specific protein
        domains which allow them to participate in several different types of signaling
        pathways that control cell migration. Neuropilins contain a large N-terminal
        extracellular domain, made up of complement-binding, coagulation factor V/VIII,
        and meprin domains. These proteins also contains a short membrane-spanning
        domain and a small cytoplasmic domain. Neuropilins bind many ligands and various
        types of co-receptors; they affect cell survival, migration, and ...


        GLI1: This gene encodes a member of the Kruppel family of zinc finger proteins.
        The encoded transcription factor is activated by the sonic hedgehog signal
        transduction cascade and regulates stem cell proliferation. The activity and
        nuclear localization of this protein is negatively r...


        CELSR1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the flamingo subfamily,
        part of the cadherin superfamily. The flamingo subfamily consists of nonclassic-type
        cadherins; a subpopulation that does not interact with catenins. The flamingo
        cadherins are located at the plasma membrane and have nine cadherin domains,
        seven epidermal growth factor-like repeats and two laminin A G-type repeats
        in their ectodomain. They also have seven transmembrane domains, a characteristic
        unique to this subfamily. It is postulated that these proteins are receptors
        involved in contact-mediate...


        HEY1: This gene encodes a nuclear protein belonging to the hairy and enhancer
        of split-related (HESR) family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type transcriptional
        repressors. Expression of this gene is induced by the Notch and c-Jun signal
        transduction pathways. Two similar and redundant genes in mouse are required
        for embryon...


        TLE3: This gene encodes a transcriptional co-repressor protein that belongs
        to the transducin-like enhancer family of proteins. The members of this family
        function in the Notch signaling pathway that regulates determination of cell
        fate during development. Expression of this gene has been associated with
        a favorable outcome to chemotherapy with taxanes for ovarian carcinoma. Altern...


        MYH9: This gene encodes a conventional non-muscle myosin; this protein should
        not be confused with the unconventional myosin-9a or 9b (MYO9A or MYO9B).
        The encoded protein is a myosin IIA heavy chain that contains an IQ domain
        and a myosin head-like domain which is involved in several important functions,
        including cytokinesis, cell motility and maintenance of cell shape. Defects
        in this gene have been associated with non-syndromic sen...


        ADGRG1: This gene encodes a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family
        and regulates brain cortical patterning. The encoded protein binds specifically
        to transglutaminase 2, a component of tissue and tumor stroma implicated as
        an inhibitor of tumor progression. Mutations in this gene are associated ...


        CNTFR: This gene encodes a member of the type 1 cytokine receptor family.
        The encoded protein is the ligand-specific component of a tripartite receptor
        for ciliary neurotrophic factor, which plays a critical role in neuronal cell
        survival, differentiation and gene expression. Binding of ciliary neurotrophic
        factor to the encoded protein recruits the transmembrane components of the
        receptor, gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, facilitating signal
        tran...


        NRCAM: Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily.
        This gene encodes a neuronal cell adhesion molecule with multiple immunoglobulin-like
        C2-type domains and fibronectin type-III domains. This ankyrin-binding protein
        is involved in neuron-neuron adhesion and promotes directional signaling during
        axonal cone growth. This gene is also expressed in non-neural tissues and
        may play a general role in cell-cell communication via signaling from its
        intracellular doma...


        OPHN1: This gene encodes a Rho-GTPase-activating protein that promotes GTP
        hydrolysis of Rho subfamily members. Rho proteins are important mediators
        of intracellular signal transduction, which affects cell migration and cell
        morphogenesis. Mutations in this gene are resp...


        NF1: This gene product appears to function as a negative regulator of the
        ras signal transduction pathway. Mutations in this gene have been linked to
        neurofibromatosis type 1, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and Watson syndrome.
        The mRNA for this gene is subject to RNA editing (CGA>UGA->Arg1306Term) resulting
        in ...


        L1CAM: The protein encoded by this gene is an axonal glycoprotein belonging
        to the immunoglobulin supergene family. The ectodomain, consisting of several
        immunoglobulin-like domains and fibronectin-like repeats (type III), is linked
        via a single transmembrane sequence to a conserved cytoplasmic domain. This
        cell adhesion molecule plays an important role in nervous system development,
        including neuronal migration and differentiation. Mutations in the gene cause
        X-linked neurological syndromes known as CRAS...


        NRP2: This gene encodes a member of the neuropilin family of receptor proteins.
        The encoded transmembrane protein binds to SEMA3C protein {sema domain, immunoglobulin
        domain (Ig), short basic domain, secreted, (semaphorin) 3C} and SEMA3F protein
        {sema domain, immunoglobulin domain (Ig), short basic domain, secreted, (semaphorin)
        3F}, and interacts with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This protein
        may...


        DPYSL2: This gene encodes a member of the collapsin response mediator protein
        family. Collapsin response mediator proteins form homo- and hetero-tetramers
        and facilitate neuron guidance, growth and polarity. The encoded protein promotes
        microtubule assembly and is required for Sema3A-mediated growth cone collapse,
        and also plays a role in synaptic signaling through interactions with calcium
        channels. This gene has been implicated in multiple neurological ...


        AMOT: This gene belongs to the motin family of angiostatin binding proteins
        characterized by conserved coiled-coil domains and C-terminal PDZ binding
        motifs. The encoded protein is expressed predominantly in endothelial cells
        of capillaries as well as larger vessels of the placenta where it may mediate
        the inhibitory effect of angiostatin on tube formation and the migratio...


        SLIT1: Enables Roundabout binding activity. Involved in axon extension involved
        in axon guidance; motor neuron axon guidance; and negative chemotaxis. Predicted
        to be located in extracellular r...


        RASA1: The protein encoded by this gene is located in the cytoplasm and is
        part of the GAP1 family of GTPase-activating proteins. The gene product stimulates
        the GTPase activity of normal RAS p21 but not its oncogenic counterpart. Acting
        as a suppressor of RAS function, the protein enhances the weak intrinsic GTPase
        activity of RAS proteins resulting in the inactive GDP-bound form of RAS,
        thereby allowing control of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Mutations
        leading to changes in the binding sites of either protein are associated with
        basal cell carcinomas. Mutations also have been associated with hereditary
        cap...


        VLDLR: The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family consists of
        cell surface proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific
        ligands. This gene encodes a lipoprotein receptor that is a member of the
        LDLR family and plays important roles in VLDL-triglyceride metabolism and
        the reelin signaling pathway. Mutations in...


        CRMP1: This gene encodes a member of a family of cytosolic phosphoproteins
        expressed exclusively in the nervous system. The encoded protein is thought
        to be a part of the semaphorin signal transduction pathway implicated in semaphorin-induced
        grow...


        SHH: This gene encodes a protein that is instrumental in patterning the early
        embryo. It has been implicated as the key inductive signal in patterning of
        the ventral neural tube, the anterior-posterior limb axis, and the ventral
        somites. Of three human proteins showing sequence and functional similarity
        to the sonic hedgehog protein of Drosophila, this protein is the most similar.
        The protein is made as a precursor that is autocatalytically cleaved; the
        N-terminal portion is soluble and contains the signalling activity while the
        C-terminal portion is involved in precursor processing. More importantly,
        the C-terminal product covalently attaches a cholesterol moiety to the N-terminal
        product, restricting the N-terminal product to the cell surface and preventing
        it from freely diffusing throughout the developing embryo. Defects in this
        protein or in its signalling pathway are a cause of holoprosencephaly (HPE),
        a disorder in which the developing forebrain fails to correctly separate into
        rig...


        SCG2: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the chromogranin/secretogranin
        family of neuroendocrine secretory proteins. Studies in rodents suggest that
        the full-length protein, secretogranin II, is involved in the packaging or
        sorting of peptide hormones and neuropeptides into secretory vesicles. The
        full-length prote...


        TLE1: Enables identical protein binding activity and transcription corepressor
        activity. Involved in negative regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling;
        negative regulation of anoikis; and regulation of gene expression...


        ETS2: This gene encodes a transcription factor which regulates genes involved
        in development and apoptosis. The encoded protein is also a protooncogene
        and shown to be involved in regulation of telomerase. A pseudogene of this
        gen...


        LDB1: Enables LIM domain binding activity; RNA polymerase II-specific DNA-binding
        transcription factor binding activity; and enzyme binding activity. Involved
        in negative regulation of transcription, DNA-templated and positive regulation
        of transcr...


        PML: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tripartite motif
        (TRIM) family. The TRIM motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a RING,
        a B-box type 1 and a B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region. This phosphoprotein
        localizes to nuclear bodies where it functions as a transcription factor and
        tumor suppressor. Its expression is cell-cycle related and it regulates the
        p53 response to oncogenic signals. The gene is often involved in the translocation
        with the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene associated with acute promyelocyti...


        CDK5R1: The protein encoded by this gene (p35) is a neuron-specific activator
        of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5); the activation of CDK5 is required for
        proper development of the central nervous system. The p35 form of this protein
        is proteolytically cleaved by calpain, generating a p25 form. The cleavage
        of p35 into p25 results in relocalization of the protein from the cell periphery
        to nuclear and perinuclear regions. P25 deregulates CDK5 activity by prolonging
        its activation and changing its cellular location. The p25 form accumu...

        Here are the gene summaries:



        ACHE: Acetylcholinesterase hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine
        at neuromuscular junctions and brain cholinergic synapses, and thus terminates
        signal transmission. It is also found on the red blood cell membranes, where
        it constitutes the Yt blood group antigen. Acetylcholinesterase exists in
        multiple molecular forms which possess similar catalytic properties, but differ
        in their oligomeric assembly and mode of cell attachment to the cell surface.
        It is encoded by the single ACHE gene, and the structural diversity in the
        gene products arises from alternative mRNA splicing, and post-translational
        associations of catalytic and structural subunits. The major form of acetylcholinesterase
        found in brain, muscle and other tissues is the hydrophilic species, which
        forms disulfide-linked oligomers with collagenous, or lipid-containing stru...


        HEY2: This gene encodes a member of the hairy and enhancer of split-related
        (HESR) family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type transcription factors.
        The encoded protein forms homo- or hetero-dimers that localize to the nucleus
        and interact with a histone deacetylase complex to repress transcription.
        Expression of this gene is induced by the Notch signal transduction pathway.
        Two similar and redundant genes in mouse are required fo...


        THY1: This gene encodes a cell surface glycoprotein and member of the immunoglobulin
        superfamily of proteins. The encoded protein is involved in cell adhesion
        and cell communication in numerous cell types, but particularly in cells of
        the immune and nervous systems. The encoded protein is widely used as a marker
        for hematopoie...


        PTCH1: This gene encodes a member of the patched family of proteins and a
        component of the hedgehog signaling pathway. Hedgehog signaling is important
        in embryonic development and tumorigenesis. The encoded protein is the receptor
        for the secreted hedgehog ligands, which include sonic hedgehog, indian hedgehog
        and desert hedgehog. Following binding by one of the hedgehog ligands, the
        encoded protein is trafficked away from the primary cilium, ...


        UNC5C: This gene product belongs to the UNC-5 family of netrin receptors.
        Netrins are secreted proteins that direct axon extension and cell migration
        during neural development. They are bifunctional proteins that act as attractants
        for some cell types and as repellents for others, and these opposite actions
        are thought to be mediated by two classes of receptors. The UNC-5 family of
        recepto...


        NKX6-1: In the pancreas, NKX6.1 is required for the development of beta cells
        and is a potent bifunctional transcription regulator that binds to AT-rich
        sequences within the pr...


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expr...


        NRP1: This gene encodes one of two neuropilins, which contain specific protein
        domains which allow them to participate in several different types of signaling
        pathways that control cell migration. Neuropilins contain a large N-terminal
        extracellular domain, made up of complement-binding, coagulation factor V/VIII,
        and meprin domains. These proteins also contains a short membrane-spanning
        domain and a small cytoplasmic domain. Neuropilins bind many ligands and various
        types of co-receptors; they affect cell survival, migration, and ...


        GLI1: This gene encodes a member of the Kruppel family of zinc finger proteins.
        The encoded transcription factor is activated by the sonic hedgehog signal
        transduction cascade and regulates stem cell proliferation. The activity and
        nuclear localization of this protein is negatively r...


        CELSR1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the flamingo subfamily,
        part of the cadherin superfamily. The flamingo subfamily consists of nonclassic-type
        cadherins; a subpopulation that does not interact with catenins. The flamingo
        cadherins are located at the plasma membrane and have nine cadherin domains,
        seven epidermal growth factor-like repeats and two laminin A G-type repeats
        in their ectodomain. They also have seven transmembrane domains, a characteristic
        unique to this subfamily. It is postulated that these proteins are receptors
        involved in contact-mediate...


        HEY1: This gene encodes a nuclear protein belonging to the hairy and enhancer
        of split-related (HESR) family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type transcriptional
        repressors. Expression of this gene is induced by the Notch and c-Jun signal
        transduction pathways. Two similar and redundant genes in mouse are required
        for embryon...


        TLE3: This gene encodes a transcriptional co-repressor protein that belongs
        to the transducin-like enhancer family of proteins. The members of this family
        function in the Notch signaling pathway that regulates determination of cell
        fate during development. Expression of this gene has been associated with
        a favorable outcome to chemotherapy with taxanes for ovarian carcinoma. Altern...


        MYH9: This gene encodes a conventional non-muscle myosin; this protein should
        not be confused with the unconventional myosin-9a or 9b (MYO9A or MYO9B).
        The encoded protein is a myosin IIA heavy chain that contains an IQ domain
        and a myosin head-like domain which is involved in several important functions,
        including cytokinesis, cell motility and maintenance of cell shape. Defects
        in this gene have been associated with non-syndromic sen...


        ADGRG1: This gene encodes a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family
        and regulates brain cortical patterning. The encoded protein binds specifically
        to transglutaminase 2, a component of tissue and tumor stroma implicated as
        an inhibitor of tumor progression. Mutations in this gene are associated ...


        CNTFR: This gene encodes a member of the type 1 cytokine receptor family.
        The encoded protein is the ligand-specific component of a tripartite receptor
        for ciliary neurotrophic factor, which plays a critical role in neuronal cell
        survival, differentiation and gene expression. Binding of ciliary neurotrophic
        factor to the encoded protein recruits the transmembrane components of the
        receptor, gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, facilitating signal
        tran...


        NRCAM: Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily.
        This gene encodes a neuronal cell adhesion molecule with multiple immunoglobulin-like
        C2-type domains and fibronectin type-III domains. This ankyrin-binding protein
        is involved in neuron-neuron adhesion and promotes directional signaling during
        axonal cone growth. This gene is also expressed in non-neural tissues and
        may play a general role in cell-cell communication via signaling from its
        intracellular doma...


        OPHN1: This gene encodes a Rho-GTPase-activating protein that promotes GTP
        hydrolysis of Rho subfamily members. Rho proteins are important mediators
        of intracellular signal transduction, which affects cell migration and cell
        morphogenesis. Mutations in this gene are resp...


        NF1: This gene product appears to function as a negative regulator of the
        ras signal transduction pathway. Mutations in this gene have been linked to
        neurofibromatosis type 1, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and Watson syndrome.
        The mRNA for this gene is subject to RNA editing (CGA>UGA->Arg1306Term) resulting
        in ...


        L1CAM: The protein encoded by this gene is an axonal glycoprotein belonging
        to the immunoglobulin supergene family. The ectodomain, consisting of several
        immunoglobulin-like domains and fibronectin-like repeats (type III), is linked
        via a single transmembrane sequence to a conserved cytoplasmic domain. This
        cell adhesion molecule plays an important role in nervous system development,
        including neuronal migration and differentiation. Mutations in the gene cause
        X-linked neurological syndromes known as CRAS...


        NRP2: This gene encodes a member of the neuropilin family of receptor proteins.
        The encoded transmembrane protein binds to SEMA3C protein {sema domain, immunoglobulin
        domain (Ig), short basic domain, secreted, (semaphorin) 3C} and SEMA3F protein
        {sema domain, immunoglobulin domain (Ig), short basic domain, secreted, (semaphorin)
        3F}, and interacts with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This protein
        may...


        DPYSL2: This gene encodes a member of the collapsin response mediator protein
        family. Collapsin response mediator proteins form homo- and hetero-tetramers
        and facilitate neuron guidance, growth and polarity. The encoded protein promotes
        microtubule assembly and is required for Sema3A-mediated growth cone collapse,
        and also plays a role in synaptic signaling through interactions with calcium
        channels. This gene has been implicated in multiple neurological ...


        AMOT: This gene belongs to the motin family of angiostatin binding proteins
        characterized by conserved coiled-coil domains and C-terminal PDZ binding
        motifs. The encoded protein is expressed predominantly in endothelial cells
        of capillaries as well as larger vessels of the placenta where it may mediate
        the inhibitory effect of angiostatin on tube formation and the migratio...


        SLIT1: Enables Roundabout binding activity. Involved in axon extension involved
        in axon guidance; motor neuron axon guidance; and negative chemotaxis. Predicted
        to be located in extracellular r...


        RASA1: The protein encoded by this gene is located in the cytoplasm and is
        part of the GAP1 family of GTPase-activating proteins. The gene product stimulates
        the GTPase activity of normal RAS p21 but not its oncogenic counterpart. Acting
        as a suppressor of RAS function, the protein enhances the weak intrinsic GTPase
        activity of RAS proteins resulting in the inactive GDP-bound form of RAS,
        thereby allowing control of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Mutations
        leading to changes in the binding sites of either protein are associated with
        basal cell carcinomas. Mutations also have been associated with hereditary
        cap...


        VLDLR: The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family consists of
        cell surface proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific
        ligands. This gene encodes a lipoprotein receptor that is a member of the
        LDLR family and plays important roles in VLDL-triglyceride metabolism and
        the reelin signaling pathway. Mutations in...


        CRMP1: This gene encodes a member of a family of cytosolic phosphoproteins
        expressed exclusively in the nervous system. The encoded protein is thought
        to be a part of the semaphorin signal transduction pathway implicated in semaphorin-induced
        grow...


        SHH: This gene encodes a protein that is instrumental in patterning the early
        embryo. It has been implicated as the key inductive signal in patterning of
        the ventral neural tube, the anterior-posterior limb axis, and the ventral
        somites. Of three human proteins showing sequence and functional similarity
        to the sonic hedgehog protein of Drosophila, this protein is the most similar.
        The protein is made as a precursor that is autocatalytically cleaved; the
        N-terminal portion is soluble and contains the signalling activity while the
        C-terminal portion is involved in precursor processing. More importantly,
        the C-terminal product covalently attaches a cholesterol moiety to the N-terminal
        product, restricting the N-terminal product to the cell surface and preventing
        it from freely diffusing throughout the developing embryo. Defects in this
        protein or in its signalling pathway are a cause of holoprosencephaly (HPE),
        a disorder in which the developing forebrain fails to correctly separate into
        rig...


        SCG2: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the chromogranin/secretogranin
        family of neuroendocrine secretory proteins. Studies in rodents suggest that
        the full-length protein, secretogranin II, is involved in the packaging or
        sorting of peptide hormones and neuropeptides into secretory vesicles. The
        full-length prote...


        TLE1: Enables identical protein binding activity and transcription corepressor
        activity. Involved in negative regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling;
        negative regulation of anoikis; and regulation of gene expression...


        ETS2: This gene encodes a transcription factor which regulates genes involved
        in development and apoptosis. The encoded protein is also a protooncogene
        and shown to be involved in regulation of telomerase. A pseudogene of this
        gen...


        LDB1: Enables LIM domain binding activity; RNA polymerase II-specific DNA-binding
        transcription factor binding activity; and enzyme binding activity. Involved
        in negative regulation of transcription, DNA-templated and positive regulation
        of transcr...


        PML: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tripartite motif
        (TRIM) family. The TRIM motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a RING,
        a B-box type 1 and a B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region. This phosphoprotein
        localizes to nuclear bodies where it functions as a transcription factor and
        tumor suppressor. Its expression is cell-cycle related and it regulates the
        p53 response to oncogenic signals. The gene is often involved in the translocation
        with the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene associated with acute promyelocyti...


        CDK5R1: The protein encoded by this gene (p35) is a neuron-specific activator
        of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5); the activation of CDK5 is required for
        proper development of the central nervous system. The p35 form of this protein
        is proteolytically cleaved by calpain, generating a p25 form. The cleavage
        of p35 into p25 results in relocalization of the protein from the cell periphery
        to nuclear and perinuclear regions. P25 deregulates CDK5 activity by prolonging
        its activation and changing its cellular location. The p25 form accumu...

        Here are the gene summaries:



        ACHE: Acetylcholinesterase hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine
        at neuromuscular junctions and brain cholinergic synapses, and thus terminates
        signal transmission. It is also found on the red blood cell membranes, where
        it constitutes the Yt blood group antigen. Acetylcholinesterase exists in
        multiple molecular forms which possess similar catalytic properties, but differ
        in their oligomeric assembly and mode of cell attachment to the cell surface.
        It is encoded by the single ACHE gene, and the structural diversity in the
        gene products arises from alternative mRNA splicing, and post-translational
        associations of catalytic and structural subunits. The major form of acetylcholinesterase
        found in brain, muscle and other tissues is the hydrophilic species, which
        forms disulfide-linked oligomers with collagenous, or lipid-containing stru...

        and interact with a histone deacetylase complex to repress transcription.
        Expression of this gene is induced by the Notch signal transduction pathway.
        Two similar and redundant genes in mouse are required fo...


        THY1: This gene encodes a cell surface glycoprotein and member of the immunoglobulin
        superfamily of proteins. The encoded protein is involved in cell adhesion

        in embryonic development and tumorigenesis. The encoded protein is the receptor
        for the secreted hedgehog ligands, which include sonic hedgehog, indian hedgehog
        and desert hedgehog. Following binding by one of the hedgehog ligands, the
        encoded protein is trafficked away from the primary cilium, ...


        UNC5C: This gene product belongs to the UNC-5 family of netrin receptors.
        Netrins are secreted proteins that direct axon extension and cell migration
        during neural development. They are bifunctional proteins that act as attractants
        for some cell types and as repellents for others, and these opposite actions
        are thought to be mediated by two classes of receptors. The UNC-5 family of
        recepto...


        NKX6-1: In the pancreas, NKX6.1 is required for the development of beta cells

        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expr...

        cadherins are located at the plasma membrane and have nine cadherin domains,
        seven epidermal growth factor-like repeats and two laminin A G-type repeats
        in their ectodomain. They also have seven transmembrane domains, a characteristic
        unique to this subfamily. It is postulated that these proteins are receptors
        involved in contact-mediate...


        HEY1: This gene encodes a nuclear protein belonging to the hairy and enhancer

        and a myosin head-like domain which is involved in several important functions,
        including cytokinesis, cell motility and maintenance of cell shape. Defects
        in this gene have been associated with non-syndromic sen...


        ADGRG1: This gene encodes a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family
        and regulates brain cortical patterning. The encoded protein binds specifically
        to transglutaminase 2, a component of tissue and tumor stroma implicated as

        CNTFR: This gene encodes a member of the type 1 cytokine receptor family.
        The encoded protein is the ligand-specific component of a tripartite receptor
        for ciliary neurotrophic factor, which plays a critical role in neuronal cell
        survival, differentiation and gene expression. Binding of ciliary neurotrophic
        factor to the encoded protein recruits the transmembrane components of the
        receptor, gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, facilitating signal
        tran...


        NRCAM: Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily.

        SHH: This gene encodes a protein that is instrumental in patterning the early
        embryo. It has been implicated as the key inductive signal in patterning of
        the ventral neural tube, the anterior-posterior limb axis, and the ventral
        somites. Of three human proteins showing sequence and functional similarity
        to the sonic hedgehog protein of Drosophila, this protein is the most similar.
        The protein is made as a precursor that is autocatalytically cleaved; the
        N-terminal portion is soluble and contains the signalling activity while the
        C-terminal portion is involved in precursor processing. More importantly,
        the C-terminal product covalently attaches a cholesterol moiety to the N-terminal
        product, restricting the N-terminal product to the cell surface and preventing
        it from freely diffusing throughout the developing embryo. Defects in this
        protein or in its signalling pathway are a cause of holoprosencephaly (HPE),
        a disorder in which the developing forebrain fails to correctly separate into

        (TRIM) family. The TRIM motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a RING,
        a B-box type 1 and a B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region. This phosphoprotein
        localizes to nuclear bodies where it functions as a transcription factor and
        tumor suppressor. Its expression is cell-cycle related and it regulates the
        p53 response to oncogenic signals. The gene is often involved in the translocation
        with the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene associated with acute promyelocyti...

        Here are the gene summaries:



        ACHE: Acetylcholinesterase hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine
        at neuromuscular junctions and brain cholinergic synapses, and thus terminates
        signal transmission. It is also found on the red blood cell membranes, where
        it constitutes the Yt blood group antigen. Acetylcholinesterase exists in
        multiple molecular forms which possess similar catalytic properties, but differ
        in their oligomeric assembly and mode of cell attachment to the cell surface.
        It is encoded by the single ACHE gene, and the structural diversity in the
        gene products arises from alternative mRNA splicing, and post-translational
        associations of catalytic and structural subunits. The major form of acetylcholinesterase
        found in brain, muscle and other tissues is the hydrophilic species, which
        forms disulfide-linked oligomers with collagenous, or lipid-containing stru...


        HEY2: This gene encodes a member of the hairy and enhancer of split-related
        (HESR) family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type transcription factors.
        The encoded protein forms homo- or hetero-dimers that localize to the nucleus
        and interact with a histone deacetylase complex to repress transcription.
        Expression of this gene is induced by the Notch signal transduction pathway.
        Two similar and redundant genes in mouse are required fo...


        THY1: This gene encodes a cell surface glycoprotein and member of the immunoglobulin
        superfamily of proteins. The encoded protein is involved in cell adhesion
        and cell communication in numerous cell types, but particularly in cells of
        the immune and nervous systems. The encoded protein is widely used as a marker
        for hematopoie...


        PTCH1: This gene encodes a member of the patched family of proteins and a
        component of the hedgehog signaling pathway. Hedgehog signaling is important
        in embryonic development and tumorigenesis. The encoded protein is the receptor
        for the secreted hedgehog ligands, which include sonic hedgehog, indian hedgehog
        and desert hedgehog. Following binding by one of the hedgehog ligands, the
        encoded protein is trafficked away from the primary cilium, ...


        UNC5C: This gene product belongs to the UNC-5 family of netrin receptors.
        Netrins are secreted proteins that direct axon extension and cell migration
        during neural development. They are bifunctional proteins that act as attractants
        for some cell types and as repellents for others, and these opposite actions
        are thought to be mediated by two classes of receptors. The UNC-5 family of
        recepto...


        NKX6-1: In the pancreas, NKX6.1 is required for the development of beta cells
        and is a potent bifunctional transcription regulator that binds to AT-rich
        sequences within the pr...


        VEGFA: This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes
        a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This
        growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial
        cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.
        Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel
        formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression
        is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein
        are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome.
        Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications
        of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence
        for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons
        resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally
        extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation
        termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform
        is antiangiogenic. Expr...


        NRP1: This gene encodes one of two neuropilins, which contain specific protein
        domains which allow them to participate in several different types of signaling
        pathways that control cell migration. Neuropilins contain a large N-terminal
        extracellular domain, made up of complement-binding, coagulation factor V/VIII,
        and meprin domains. These proteins also contains a short membrane-spanning
        domain and a small cytoplasmic domain. Neuropilins bind many ligands and various
        types of co-receptors; they affect cell survival, migration, and ...


        GLI1: This gene encodes a member of the Kruppel family of zinc finger proteins.
        The encoded transcription factor is activated by the sonic hedgehog signal
        transduction cascade and regulates stem cell proliferation. The activity and
        nuclear localization of this protein is negatively r...


        CELSR1: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the flamingo subfamily,
        part of the cadherin superfamily. The flamingo subfamily consists of nonclassic-type
        cadherins; a subpopulation that does not interact with catenins. The flamingo
        cadherins are located at the plasma membrane and have nine cadherin domains,
        seven epidermal growth factor-like repeats and two laminin A G-type repeats
        in their ectodomain. They also have seven transmembrane domains, a characteristic
        unique to this subfamily. It is postulated that these proteins are receptors
        involved in contact-mediate...


        HEY1: This gene encodes a nuclear protein belonging to the hairy and enhancer
        of split-related (HESR) family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type transcriptional
        repressors. Expression of this gene is induced by the Notch and c-Jun signal
        transduction pathways. Two similar and redundant genes in mouse are required
        for embryon...

        to the transducin-like enhancer family of proteins. The members of this family
        function in the Notch signaling pathway that regulates determination of cell
        fate during development. Expression of this gene has been associated with
        a favorable outcome to chemotherapy with taxanes for ovarian carcinoma. Altern...


        MYH9: This gene encodes a conventional non-muscle myosin; this protein should
        not be confused with the unconventional myosin-9a or 9b (MYO9A or MYO9B).
        The encoded protein is a myosin IIA heavy chain that contains an IQ domain
        and a myosin head-like domain which is involved in several important functions,
        including cytokinesis, cell motility and maintenance of cell shape. Defects
        in this gene have been associated with non-syndromic sen...


        ADGRG1: This gene encodes a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family
        and regulates brain cortical patterning. The encoded protein binds specifically
        to transglutaminase 2, a component of tissue and tumor stroma implicated as
        an inhibitor of tumor progression. Mutations in this gene are associated ...


        CNTFR: This gene encodes a member of the type 1 cytokine receptor family.
        The encoded protein is the ligand-specific component of a tripartite receptor
        for ciliary neurotrophic factor, which plays a critical role in neuronal cell
        survival, differentiation and gene expression. Binding of ciliary neurotrophic
        factor to the encoded protein recruits the transmembrane components of the
        receptor, gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, facilitating signal
        tran...


        NRCAM: Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily.
        This gene encodes a neuronal cell adhesion molecule with multiple immunoglobulin-like
        C2-type domains and fibronectin type-III domains. This ankyrin-binding protein
        is involved in neuron-neuron adhesion and promotes directional signaling during
        axonal cone growth. This gene is also expressed in non-neural tissues and
        may play a general role in cell-cell communication via signaling from its
        intracellular doma...


        OPHN1: This gene encodes a Rho-GTPase-activating protein that promotes GTP
        hydrolysis of Rho subfamily members. Rho proteins are important mediators
        of intracellular signal transduction, which affects cell migration and cell
        morphogenesis. Mutations in this gene are resp...


        NF1: This gene product appears to function as a negative regulator of the
        ras signal transduction pathway. Mutations in this gene have been linked to
        neurofibromatosis type 1, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and Watson syndrome.
        The mRNA for this gene is subject to RNA editing (CGA>UGA->Arg1306Term) resulting
        in ...


        L1CAM: The protein encoded by this gene is an axonal glycoprotein belonging
        to the immunoglobulin supergene family. The ectodomain, consisting of several
        immunoglobulin-like domains and fibronectin-like repeats (type III), is linked
        via a single transmembrane sequence to a conserved cytoplasmic domain. This
        cell adhesion molecule plays an important role in nervous system development,
        including neuronal migration and differentiation. Mutations in the gene cause
        X-linked neurological syndromes known as CRAS...


        NRP2: This gene encodes a member of the neuropilin family of receptor proteins.
        The encoded transmembrane protein binds to SEMA3C protein {sema domain, immunoglobulin
        domain (Ig), short basic domain, secreted, (semaphorin) 3C} and SEMA3F protein
        {sema domain, immunoglobulin domain (Ig), short basic domain, secreted, (semaphorin)
        3F}, and interacts with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This protein
        may...


        DPYSL2: This gene encodes a member of the collapsin response mediator protein
        family. Collapsin response mediator proteins form homo- and hetero-tetramers
        and facilitate neuron guidance, growth and polarity. The encoded protein promotes
        microtubule assembly and is required for Sema3A-mediated growth cone collapse,
        and also plays a role in synaptic signaling through interactions with calcium
        channels. This gene has been implicated in multiple neurological ...


        AMOT: This gene belongs to the motin family of angiostatin binding proteins
        characterized by conserved coiled-coil domains and C-terminal PDZ binding
        motifs. The encoded protein is expressed predominantly in endothelial cells
        of capillaries as well as larger vessels of the placenta where it may mediate
        the inhibitory effect of angiostatin on tube formation and the migratio...


        SLIT1: Enables Roundabout binding activity. Involved in axon extension involved
        in axon guidance; motor neuron axon guidance; and negative chemotaxis. Predicted
        to be located in extracellular r...


        RASA1: The protein encoded by this gene is located in the cytoplasm and is
        part of the GAP1 family of GTPase-activating proteins. The gene product stimulates
        the GTPase activity of normal RAS p21 but not its oncogenic counterpart. Acting
        as a suppressor of RAS function, the protein enhances the weak intrinsic GTPase
        activity of RAS proteins resulting in the inactive GDP-bound form of RAS,
        thereby allowing control of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Mutations
        leading to changes in the binding sites of either protein are associated with
        basal cell carcinomas. Mutations also have been associated with hereditary
        cap...
