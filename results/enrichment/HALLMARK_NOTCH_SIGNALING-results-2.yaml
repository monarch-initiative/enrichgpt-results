        Here are the gene summaries:



        APH1A: This gene encodes a component of the gamma secretase complex that cleaves
        integral membrane proteins such as Notch receptors and beta-amyloid precursor
        protein. The gamma secretase complex contains this gene product, or the paralogous
        anterior pharynx defective 1 homolog B (APH1B), along with the presenilin,
        nicastrin, and presenilin enhancer-2 proteins. The precise function of this
        seven-transmembrane-domain protein is unknown though it is suspected of facilitating
        the association of nicastrin and presenilin in the gamma secretase complex
        as well as interacting with substrates of the gamma secretase complex prior
        to their proteolytic processing. Polymorphisms in a promoter region of this
        gene have been associated with an incre...


        ARRB1: Members of arrestin/beta-arrestin protein family are thought to participate
        in agonist-mediated desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors and cause
        specific dampening of cellular responses to stimuli such as hormones, neurotransmitters,
        or sensory signals. Arrestin beta 1 is a cytosolic protein and acts as a cofactor
        in the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (BARK) mediated desensitization of
        beta-adrenergic receptors. Besides the central nervous system, it is expressed
        at high levels in peripheral blood leukocytes, and thus the BARK/beta-arrestin
        system is believed to play a major role in regulating receptor-med...


        CCND1: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin
        family, whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein
        abundance throughout the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK
        kinases. Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns
        which contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This
        cyclin forms a complex with and functions as a regulatory subunit of CDK4
        or CDK6, whose activity is required for cell cycle G1/S transition. This protein
        has been shown to interact with tumor suppressor protein Rb and the expression
        of this gene is regulated positively by Rb. Mutations, a...

        DTX1: Studies in Drosophila have identified this gene as encoding a positive
        regulator of the Notch-signaling pathway. The human gene encodes a protein

        FBXW11: This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family which is characterized
        by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F-box. The F-box proteins constitute
        one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box),
        which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins
        are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing
        leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein
        interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this
        gene belongs to the Fbws class and, in addition to an F-box, contains multiple
        WD40 repeats. This gene contains ...


        FZD1: Members of the ''frizzled'' gene family encode 7-transmembrane domain
        proteins that are receptors for Wnt signaling proteins.  The FZD1 protein

        region, 7 transmembrane domains, and a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif.  The
        FZ...


        FZD5: Members of the ''frizzled'' gene family encode 7-transmembrane domain
        proteins that are receptors for Wnt signaling proteins.  The FZD5 protein

        FZD7: Members of the ''frizzled'' gene family encode 7-transmembrane domain
        proteins that are receptors for Wnt signaling proteins.  The FZD7 protein
        contains an N-terminal signal sequence, 10 cysteine residues typical of the
        cysteine-rich extracellular domain of Fz family members, 7 putative transmembrane
        domains, and an intracellular C-terminal tail with a PDZ domain-binding motif.  FZD7
        gene expression may downregulate APC function and enhance be...


        HES1: This protein belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription
        factors. It is a transcriptional repressor of genes that require a bHLH protein
        for their transcription. The protein has a particular type of basic domain
        that contains a helix interrupting protein that binds to t...


        HEYL: This gene encodes a member of the hairy and enhancer of split-related
        (HESR) family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type transcription factors.
        The sequence of the encoded protein contains a conserved bHLH and orange domain,
        but its YRPW motif has diverged from other HESR family members. It is thought
        to be an effector of Notch signaling and a regulator of cell fate decisions.
        Alternatively spliced transcript varian...


        JAG1: The jagged 1 protein encoded by JAG1 is the human homolog of the Drosophilia
        jagged protein. Human jagged 1 is the ligand for the receptor notch 1, the
        latter is involved in signaling processes. Mutations that alter the jagged
        1 protein cause Alagille syndrome. Jagged 1 signalling through notch 1 has
        al...


        KAT2A: KAT2A, or GCN5, is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that functions
        primarily as a transcriptional activator. It also functions as a repressor
        of NF-kappa-B (see MIM 164011) by promoting ubiquitination of the NF-kappa-B
        subunit RELA (MIM 164014) in a HAT-independent mann...


        LFNG: This gene is a member of the glycosyltransferase 31 gene family. Members
        of this gene family, which also includes the MFNG (GeneID: 4242) and RFNG
        (GeneID: 5986) genes, encode evolutionarily conserved glycosyltransferases
        that act in the Notch signaling pathway to define boundaries during embryonic
        development. While their genomic structure is distinct from other glycosyltransferases,
        these proteins have a fucose-specific beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase
        activity that leads to elongation of O-linked fucose residues on Notch, which
        alters Notch signaling. The protein encoded by this gene is predicted to be
        a single-pass type II Golgi membrane protein but it may also be secreted and
        proteolytically processed like the re...


        MAML2: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Mastermind-like
        family of proteins. All family members are proline and glutamine-rich, and
        contain a conserved basic domain that binds the ankyrin repeat domain of the
        intracellular domain of the Notch receptors (ICN1-4) in their N-terminus,

        of this Type I transmembrane protein family share structural characteristics
        including an extracellular domain consisting of multiple epidermal growth
        factor-like (EGF) repeats, and an intracellular domain consisting of multiple
        different domain types. Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular
        signaling pathway that regulates interactions between physically adjacent
        cells through binding of Notch family receptors to their cognate ligands.
        The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed in the trans-Golgi

        domain types. Notch family members play a role in a variety of developmental
        processes by controlling cell fate decisions. The Notch signaling network
        is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular signaling pathway which regulates
        interactions between physically adjacent cells. In Drosophilia, notch interaction
        with its cell-bound ligands (delta, serrate) establishes an intercellular

        the ligand-induced transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator activated
        receptors alpha and gamma, though evidence for this effect is inconsistent.
        Expression of this gene in colorectal cancer cells may be variable but is

        PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class
        of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression
        profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded

        carry mutations in the presenilin proteins (PSEN1 or PSEN2) or the amyloid
        precursor protein (APP). These disease-linked mutations result in increased
        production of the longer form of amyloid-beta (main component of amyloid deposits
        found in AD brains). Presenilins are postulated to regulate APP processing
        through their effects on gamma-secretase, an enzyme that cleaves APP. Also,
        it is thought that the presenilins are involved in the cleavage of the Notch
        receptor such that, they either directly regulate gamma-secretase activity,

        this protein, cullin 1, a ring-box protein, and one member of the F-box family
        of proteins. This protein binds directly to the F-box motif found in F-box
        proteins. SCF complexes are involved in the regulated ubiquitination of specific
        protein substrates, which targets them for degradation by the proteosome.
        Specific F-box proteins recognize different target protein(s), and many specific
        SCF substrates have been identified including regulators of cell cycle progression
        and development. Studies have also characterized the protein as an RNA polymerase
        II elongation facto...


        ST3GAL6: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the sialyltransferase

        positions on sialylated glycolipids (gangliosides) or to the N- or O-linked
        sugar chains of glycoproteins. This protein has high specificity for neolactotetraosylceramide

        APH1A: This gene encodes a component of the gamma secretase complex that cleaves
        integral membrane proteins such as Notch receptors and beta-amyloid precursor
        protein. The gamma secretase complex contains this gene product, or the paralogous
        anterior pharynx defective 1 homolog B (APH1B), along with the presenilin,
        nicastrin, and presenilin enhancer-2 proteins. The precise function of this
        seven-transmembrane-domain protein is unknown though it is suspected of facilitating
        the association of nicastrin and presenilin in the gamma secretase complex
        as well as interacting with substrates of the gamma secretase complex prior
        to their proteolytic processing. Polymorphisms in a promoter region of this
        gene have been associated with an incre...


        ARRB1: Members of arrestin/beta-arrestin protein family are thought to participate
        in agonist-mediated desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors and cause
        specific dampening of cellular responses to stimuli such as hormones, neurotransmitters,
        or sensory signals. Arrestin beta 1 is a cytosolic protein and acts as a cofactor
        in the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (BARK) mediated desensitization of
        beta-adrenergic receptors. Besides the central nervous system, it is expressed
        at high levels in peripheral blood leukocytes, and thus the BARK/beta-arrestin
        system is believed to play a major role in regulating receptor-med...


        CCND1: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin
        family, whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein
        abundance throughout the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK
        kinases. Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns
        which contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This
        cyclin forms a complex with and functions as a regulatory subunit of CDK4
        or CDK6, whose activity is required for cell cycle G1/S transition. This protein
        has been shown to interact with tumor suppressor protein Rb and the expression
        of this gene is regulated positively by Rb. Mutations, a...

        FBXW11: This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family which is characterized
        by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F-box. The F-box proteins constitute
        one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box),
        which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins
        are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing
        leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein
        interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this
        gene belongs to the Fbws class and, in addition to an F-box, contains multiple
        WD40 repeats. This gene contains ...

        FZD7: Members of the ''frizzled'' gene family encode 7-transmembrane domain
        proteins that are receptors for Wnt signaling proteins.  The FZD7 protein
        contains an N-terminal signal sequence, 10 cysteine residues typical of the
        cysteine-rich extracellular domain of Fz family members, 7 putative transmembrane
        domains, and an intracellular C-terminal tail with a PDZ domain-binding motif.  FZD7
        gene expression may downregulate APC function and enhance be...


        HES1: This protein belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription
        factors. It is a transcriptional repressor of genes that require a bHLH protein
        for their transcription. The protein has a particular type of basic domain
        that contains a helix interrupting protein that binds to t...


        HEYL: This gene encodes a member of the hairy and enhancer of split-related
        (HESR) family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type transcription factors.
        The sequence of the encoded protein contains a conserved bHLH and orange domain,
        but its YRPW motif has diverged from other HESR family members. It is thought
        to be an effector of Notch signaling and a regulator of cell fate decisions.
        Alternatively spliced transcript varian...


        JAG1: The jagged 1 protein encoded by JAG1 is the human homolog of the Drosophilia
        jagged protein. Human jagged 1 is the ligand for the receptor notch 1, the
        latter is involved in signaling processes. Mutations that alter the jagged
        1 protein cause Alagille syndrome. Jagged 1 signalling through notch 1 has
        al...


        KAT2A: KAT2A, or GCN5, is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that functions
        primarily as a transcriptional activator. It also functions as a repressor
        of NF-kappa-B (see MIM 164011) by promoting ubiquitination of the NF-kappa-B
        subunit RELA (MIM 164014) in a HAT-independent mann...


        LFNG: This gene is a member of the glycosyltransferase 31 gene family. Members
        of this gene family, which also includes the MFNG (GeneID: 4242) and RFNG
        (GeneID: 5986) genes, encode evolutionarily conserved glycosyltransferases
        that act in the Notch signaling pathway to define boundaries during embryonic
        development. While their genomic structure is distinct from other glycosyltransferases,
        these proteins have a fucose-specific beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase
        activity that leads to elongation of O-linked fucose residues on Notch, which
        alters Notch signaling. The protein encoded by this gene is predicted to be
        a single-pass type II Golgi membrane protein but it may also be secreted and
        proteolytically processed like the re...


        MAML2: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Mastermind-like
        family of proteins. All family members are proline and glutamine-rich, and
        contain a conserved basic domain that binds the ankyrin repeat domain of the
        intracellular domain of the Notch receptors (ICN1-4) in their N-terminus,
        and a transcriptional activation domain in their C-terminus. This protein
        binds to an extended groove that is formed by the interaction of CBF1, Suppressor
        of Hairless, LAG-1 (CSL) with ICN, and positively regulates Notch signaling.

        Here are the gene summaries:



        APH1A: This gene encodes a component of the gamma secretase complex that cleaves
        integral membrane proteins such as Notch receptors and beta-amyloid precursor
        protein. The gamma secretase complex contains this gene product, or the paralogous
        anterior pharynx defective 1 homolog B (APH1B), along with the presenilin,
        nicastrin, and presenilin enhancer-2 proteins. The precise function of this
        seven-transmembrane-domain protein is unknown though it is suspected of facilitating
        the association of nicastrin and presenilin in the gamma secretase complex
        as well as interacting with substrates of th...


        ARRB1: Members of arrestin/beta-arrestin protein family are thought to participate
        in agonist-mediated desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors and cause
        specific dampening of cellular responses to stimuli such as hormones, neurotransmitters,
        or sensory signals. Arrestin beta 1 is a cytosolic protein and acts as a cofactor
        in the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (BARK) mediated desensitization of
        beta-adrenergic receptors. Besides the central nervous system, it is expressed
        at high levels in pe...


        CCND1: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin
        family, whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein
        abundance throughout the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK
        kinases. Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns
        which contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This
        cyclin forms a complex with and functions as a regulatory subunit of CDK4
        or CDK6, whose activity is required for cell cycle G1/S transition. This protein
        ha...


        CUL1: Predicted to enable ubiquitin protein ligase binding activity and ubiquitin-protein
        transferase activity. Involved in SCF-dependent proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent

        FBXW11: This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family which is characterized
        by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F-box. The F-box proteins constitute
        one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box),
        which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins
        are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing
        leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein
        interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The pr...

        PRKCA: Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine- and threonine-specific
        protein kinases that can be activated by calcium and the second messenger
        diacylglycerol. PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein
        targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways.
        PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class
        of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression
        profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded
        by this gene is one of the PKC family members. This kinase has been reported
        to play roles in many different cellular processes, such as cell adhesion,
        cell transformation, cell cycle checkpoint, and cell v...

        that contains a helix interrupting protein that binds to t...


        FBXW11: This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family which is characterized
        by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F-box. The F-box proteins constitute
        one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box),
        which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins
        are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing
        leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein
        interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this
        gene belongs to the Fbws class and, in addition to an F-box, contains multiple
        WD40 repeats. This gene contains ...


        CCND1: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin
        family, whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein
        abundance throughout the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK
        kinases. Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns
        which contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This
        cyclin forms a complex with and functions as a regulatory subunit of CDK4
        or CDK6, whose activity is required for cell cycle G1/S transition. This protein
        has been shown to interact with tumor suppressor protein Rb and the expression
        of this gene is regulated positively by Rb. Mutations, a...


        CUL1: Predicted to enable ubiquitin protein ligase binding activity and ubiquitin-protein
        transferase activity. Involved in SCF-dependent proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent
        protein catabolic process and protein ubiquitination. Located in plasma membrane.

        DLL1: DLL1 is a human homolog of the Notch Delta ligand and is a member of
        the delta/serrate/jagged family.  It plays a role in mediating cell fate decisions
        during hematopoiesis. It may play a role in cell-to...


        SAP30: Histone acetylation plays a key role in the regulation of eukaryotic
        gene expression. Histone acetylation and deacetylation are catalyzed by multisubunit
        complexes. The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the histone
        deacetylase complex, which includes SIN3, SAP18, HDAC1, HDAC2, RbAp46, RbAp48,
        and other polypeptides. This complex is active in deacetylating core histone
        octamers, but inactive in deacetylating ...


        PSEN2: Alzheimer''s disease (AD) patients with an inherited form of the disease
        carry mutations in the presenilin proteins (PSEN1 or PSEN2) or the amyloid
        precursor protein (APP). These disease-linked mutations result in increased
        production of the longer form of amyloid-beta (main component of amyloid deposits
        found in AD brains). Presenilins are postulated to regulate APP processing
        through their effects on gamma-secretase, an enzyme that cleaves APP. Also,
        it is thought that the presenilins are involved in the cleavage of the Notch
        receptor such that, they either directly regulate gamma-secretase activity,
        or themselves act ...


        DTX1: Studies in Drosophila have identified this gene as encoding a positive
        regulator of the Notch-signaling pathway. The human gene encodes a protein
        of unknown function; however, it may play a role in basic helix-loop-helix
        tran...


        PPARD: This gene encodes a member of the peroxisome proliferator-activated
        receptor (PPAR) family. The encoded protein is thought to function as an integrator
        of transcriptional repression and nuclear receptor signaling. It may inhibit
        the ligand-induced transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator activated
        receptors alpha and gamma, though evidence for this effect is inconsistent.
        Expression of this gene in colorectal cancer cells may be variable but is
        typically relatively low. Knockout studies in mice suggested a role for this
        protein in myelination of the corpus callosum, lipid metabolism, differentiation,
        and e...


        NOTCH1: This gene encodes a member of the NOTCH family of proteins. Members
        of this Type I transmembrane protein family share structural characteristics
        including an extracellular domain consisting of multiple epidermal growth
        factor-like (EGF) repeats, and an intracellular domain consisting of multiple
        different domain types. Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular
        signaling pathway that regulates interactions between physically adjacent
        cells through binding of Notch family receptors to their cognate ligands.
        The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed in the trans-Golgi
        network to generate two polypeptide chains that heterodimerize to form the
        mature cell-surface receptor. This receptor plays a role in the development
        of numerous cell and tissue types. Mutations in this gene a...


        APH1A: This gene encodes a component of the gamma secretase complex that cleaves
        integral membrane proteins such as Notch receptors and beta-amyloid precursor
        protein. The gamma secretase complex contains this gene product, or the paralogous
        anterior pharynx defective 1 homolog B (APH1B), along with the presenilin,
        nicastrin, and presenilin enhancer-2 proteins. The precise function of this
        seven-transmembrane-domain protein is unknown though it is suspected of facilitating
        the association of nicastrin and presenilin in the gamma secretase complex
        as well as interacting with substrates of the gamma secretase complex prior
        to their proteolytic processing. Polymorphisms in a promoter region of this
        gene have been associated with an incre...


        FZD1: Members of the ''frizzled'' gene family encode 7-transmembrane domain
        proteins that are receptors for Wnt signaling proteins.  The FZD1 protein
        contains a signal peptide, a cysteine-rich domain in the N-terminal extracellular
        region, 7 transmembrane domains, and a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif.  The
        FZ...


        WNT5A: The WNT gene family consists of structurally related genes which encode
        secreted signaling proteins. These proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis
        and in several developmental processes, including regulation of cell fate
        and patterning during embryogenesis. This gene encodes a member of the WNT
        family that signals through both the canonical and non-canonical WNT pathways.
        This protein is a ligand for the seven transmembrane receptor frizzled-5 and
        the tyrosine kinase orphan receptor 2. This protein plays an essential role
        in regulating developmental pathways during embryogenesis. This protein may
        also play a role in oncogenesis. Mutat...


        LFNG: This gene is a member of the glycosyltransferase 31 gene family. Members
        of this gene family, which also includes the MFNG (GeneID: 4242) and RFNG
        (GeneID: 5986) genes, encode evolutionarily conserved glycosyltransferases
        that act in the Notch signaling pathway to define boundaries during embryonic
        development. While their genomic structure is distinct from other glycosyltransferases,
        these proteins have a fucose-specific beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase
        activity that leads to elongation of O-linked fucose residues on Notch, which
        alters Notch signaling. The protein encoded by this gene is predicted to be
        a single-pass type II Golgi membrane protein but it may also be secreted and
        proteolytically processed like the re...


        FZD5: Members of the ''frizzled'' gene family encode 7-transmembrane domain
        proteins that are receptors for Wnt signaling proteins.  The FZD5 protein
        is believed to be the receptor for the...


        RBX1: This locus encodes a RING finger-like domain-containing protein. The
        encoded protein interacts with cullin proteins and likely plays a role in
        ubiquitination processes necessary for cell cycle progression. This protein
        may also affect protein turnover. Related pseu...


        PSENEN: Presenilins, which are components of the gamma-secretase protein complex,
        are required for intramembranous processing of some type I transmembrane proteins,
        such as the Notch proteins and the beta-amyloid precursor protein. Signaling
        by Notch receptors mediates a wide range of developmental cell fates. Processing
        of the beta-amyloid precursor protein generates neurotoxic amyloid beta peptides,
        the major component of senile plaques associated with Alzheimer''s disease.
        This gene encodes a protein that is required for Notch pathway signaling,
        and for the activity and accumulation of gamma-secretase. Mutations resulting
        in haploin...


        ST3GAL6: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the sialyltransferase
        family. Members of this family are enzymes that transfer sialic acid from
        the activated cytidine 5''-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid to terminal
        positions on sialylated glycolipids (gangliosides) or to the N- or O-linked
        sugar chains of glycoproteins. This protein has high specificity for neolactotetraosylceramide
        and neolactohexaosylceramide as glycolipid substrates and may contribute to
        the formation of selectin ligands and s...


        JAG1: The jagged 1 protein encoded by JAG1 is the human homolog of the Drosophilia
        jagged protein. Human jagged 1 is the ligand for the receptor notch 1, the
        latter is involved in signaling processes. Mutations that alter the jagged
        1 protein cause Alagille syndrome. Jagged 1 signalling through notch 1 has
        al...


        DTX2: DTX2 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Takeyama et al., 2003 [PubMed
        12670957]).[supp...


        HEYL: This gene encodes a member of the hairy and enhancer of split-related
        (HESR) family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type transcription factors.
        The sequence of the encoded protein contains a conserved bHLH and orange domain,
        but its YRPW motif has diverged from other HESR family members. It is thought
        to be an effector of Notch signaling and a regulator of cell fate decisions.
        Alternatively spliced transcript varian...


        ARRB1: Members of arrestin/beta-arrestin protein family are thought to participate
        in agonist-mediated desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors and cause
        specific dampening of cellular responses to stimuli such as hormones, neurotransmitters,
        or sensory signals. Arrestin beta 1 is a cytosolic protein and acts as a cofactor
        in the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (BARK) mediated desensitization of
        beta-adrenergic receptors. Besides the central nervous system, it is expressed
        at high levels in peripheral blood leukocytes, and thus the BARK/beta-arrestin
        system is believed to play a major role in regulating receptor-med...


        SKP1: This gene encodes a component of SCF complexes, which are composed of
        this protein, cullin 1, a ring-box protein, and one member of the F-box family
        of proteins. This protein binds directly to the F-box motif found in F-box
        proteins. SCF complexes are involved in the regulated ubiquitination of specific
        protein substrates, which targets them for degradation by the proteosome.
        Specific F-box proteins recognize different target protein(s), and many specific
        SCF substrates have been identified including regulators of cell cycle progression
        and development. Studies have also characterized the protein as an RNA polymerase
        II elongation facto...


        NOTCH2: This gene encodes a member of the Notch family. Members of this Type
        1 transmembrane protein family share structural characteristics including
        an extracellular domain consisting of multiple epidermal growth factor-like
        (EGF) repeats, and an intracellular domain consisting of multiple, different
        domain types. Notch family members play a role in a variety of developmental
        processes by controlling cell fate decisions. The Notch signaling network
        is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular signaling pathway which regulates
        interactions between physically adjacent cells. In Drosophilia, notch interaction
        with its cell-bound ligands (delta, serrate) establishes an intercellular
        signaling pathway that plays a key role in development. Homologues of the
        notch-ligands have also been identified in human, but precise interactions
        between these ligands and the human notch homologues remain to be determined.
        This protein is cleaved in the trans-Golgi network, and presented on the cell
        surface as a hete...


        FZD7: Members of the ''frizzled'' gene family encode 7-transmembrane domain
        proteins that are receptors for Wnt signaling proteins.  The FZD7 protein
        contains an N-terminal signal sequence, 10 cysteine residues typical of the
        cysteine-rich extracellular domain of Fz family members, 7 putative transmembrane
        domains, and an intracellular C-terminal tail with a PDZ domain-binding motif.  FZD7
        gene expression may downregulate APC function and enhance be...


        KAT2A: KAT2A, or GCN5, is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that functions
        primarily as a transcriptional activator. It also functions as a repressor
        of NF-kappa-B (see MIM 164011) by promoting ubiquitination of the NF-kappa-B
        subunit RELA (MIM 164014) in a HAT-independent mann...

        complexes. The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the histone
        deacetylase complex, which includes SIN3, SAP18, HDAC1, HDAC2, RbAp46, RbAp48,
        and other polypeptides. This complex is active in deacetylating core histone
        octamers, but inactive in deacetylating ...


        PSEN2: Alzheimer''s disease (AD) patients with an inherited form of the disease
        carry mutations in the presenilin proteins (PSEN1 or PSEN2) or the amyloid
        precursor protein (APP). These disease-linked mutations result in increased
        production of the longer form of amyloid-beta (main component of amyloid deposits
        found in AD brains). Presenilins are postulated to regulate APP processing
        through their effects on gamma-secretase, an enzyme that cleaves APP. Also,
        it is thought that the presenilins are involved in the cleavage of the Notch
        receptor such that, they either directly regulate gamma-secretase activity,
        or themselves act ...


        DTX1: Studies in Drosophila have identified this gene as encoding a positive
        regulator of the Notch-signaling pathway. The human gene encodes a protein
        of unknown function; however, it may play a role in basic helix-loop-helix
        tran...


        PPARD: This gene encodes a member of the peroxisome proliferator-activated
        receptor (PPAR) family. The encoded protein is thought to function as an integrator
        of transcriptional repression and nuclear receptor signaling. It may inhibit
        the ligand-induced transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator activated
        receptors alpha and gamma, though evidence for this effect is inconsistent.
        Expression of this gene in colorectal cancer cells may be variable but is
        typically relatively low. Knockout studies in mice suggested a role for this
        protein in myelination of the corpus callosum, lipid metabolism, differentiation,
        and e...


        NOTCH1: This gene encodes a member of the NOTCH family of proteins. Members
        of this Type I transmembrane protein family share structural characteristics
        including an extracellular domain consisting of multiple epidermal growth
        factor-like (EGF) repeats, and an intracellular domain consisting of multiple
        different domain types. Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular
        signaling pathway that regulates interactions between physically adjacent
        cells through binding of Notch family receptors to their cognate ligands.
        The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed in the trans-Golgi
        network to generate two polypeptide chains that heterodimerize to form the
        mature cell-surface receptor. This receptor plays a role in the development
        of numerous cell and tissue types. Mutations in this gene a...


        APH1A: This gene encodes a component of the gamma secretase complex that cleaves
        integral membrane proteins such as Notch receptors and beta-amyloid precursor
        protein. The gamma secretase complex contains this gene product, or the paralogous
        anterior pharynx defective 1 homolog B (APH1B), along with the presenilin,
        nicastrin, and presenilin enhancer-2 proteins. The precise function of this
        seven-transmembrane-domain protein is unknown though it is suspected of facilitating
        the association of nicastrin and presenilin in the gamma secretase complex
        as well as interacting with substrates of the gamma secretase complex prior
        to their proteolytic processing. Polymorphisms in a promoter region of this
        gene have been associated with an incre...


        FZD1: Members of the ''frizzled'' gene family encode 7-transmembrane domain
        proteins that are receptors for Wnt signaling proteins.  The FZD1 protein
        contains a signal peptide, a cysteine-rich domain in the N-terminal extracellular
        region, 7 transmembrane domains, and a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif.  The
        FZ...


        WNT5A: The WNT gene family consists of structurally related genes which encode
        secreted signaling proteins. These proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis
        and in several developmental processes, including regulation of cell fate
        and patterning during embryogenesis. This gene encodes a member of the WNT
        family that signals through both the canonical and non-canonical WNT pathways.
        This protein is a ligand for the seven transmembrane receptor frizzled-5 and
        the tyrosine kinase orphan receptor 2. This protein plays an essential role
        in regulating developmental pathways during embryogenesis. This protein may
        also play a role in oncogenesis. Mutat...


        LFNG: This gene is a member of the glycosyltransferase 31 gene family. Members
        of this gene family, which also includes the MFNG (GeneID: 4242) and RFNG
        (GeneID: 5986) genes, encode evolutionarily conserved glycosyltransferases
        that act in the Notch signaling pathway to define boundaries during embryonic
        development. While their genomic structure is distinct from other glycosyltransferases,
        these proteins have a fucose-specific beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase
        activity that leads to elongation of O-linked fucose residues on Notch, which
        alters Notch signaling. The protein encoded by this gene is predicted to be
        a single-pass type II Golgi membrane protein but it may also be secreted and
        proteolytically processed like the re...


        FZD5: Members of the ''frizzled'' gene family encode 7-transmembrane domain
        proteins that are receptors for Wnt signaling proteins.  The FZD5 protein
        is believed to be the receptor for the...


        RBX1: This locus encodes a RING finger-like domain-containing protein. The
        encoded protein interacts with cullin proteins and likely plays a role in
        ubiquitination processes necessary for cell cycle progression. This protein
        may also affect protein turnover. Related pseu...


        PSENEN: Presenilins, which are components of the gamma-secretase protein complex,
        are required for intramembranous processing of some type I transmembrane proteins,
        such as the Notch proteins and the beta-amyloid precursor protein. Signaling
        by Notch receptors mediates a wide range of developmental cell fates. Processing
        of the beta-amyloid precursor protein generates neurotoxic amyloid beta peptides,
        the major component of senile plaques associated with Alzheimer''s disease.
        This gene encodes a protein that is required for Notch pathway signaling,
        and for the activity and accumulation of gamma-secretase. Mutations resulting
        in haploin...


        ST3GAL6: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the sialyltransferase
        family. Members of this family are enzymes that transfer sialic acid from
        the activated cytidine 5''-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid to terminal
        positions on sialylated glycolipids (gangliosides) or to the N- or O-linked
        sugar chains of glycoproteins. This protein has high specificity for neolactotetraosylceramide
        and neolactohexaosylceramide as glycolipid substrates and may contribute to
        the formation of selectin ligands and s...


        JAG1: The jagged 1 protein encoded by JAG1 is the human homolog of the Drosophilia
        jagged protein. Human jagged 1 is the ligand for the receptor notch 1, the
        latter is involved in signaling processes. Mutations that alter the jagged
        1 protein cause Alagille syndrome. Jagged 1 signalling through notch 1 has
        al...


        DTX2: DTX2 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Takeyama et al., 2003 [PubMed
        12670957]).[supp...


        HEYL: This gene encodes a member of the hairy and enhancer of split-related
        (HESR) family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type transcription factors.
        The sequence of the encoded protein contains a conserved bHLH and orange domain,
        but its YRPW motif has diverged from other HESR family members. It is thought
        to be an effector of Notch signaling and a regulator of cell fate decisions.
        Alternatively spliced transcript varian...


        ARRB1: Members of arrestin/beta-arrestin protein family are thought to participate
        in agonist-mediated desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors and cause
        specific dampening of cellular responses to stimuli such as hormones, neurotransmitters,
        or sensory signals. Arrestin beta 1 is a cytosolic protein and acts as a cofactor
        in the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (BARK) mediated desensitization of
        beta-adrenergic receptors. Besides the central nervous system, it is expressed
        at high levels in peripheral blood leukocytes, and thus the BARK/beta-arrestin
        system is believed to play a major role in regulating receptor-med...


        SKP1: This gene encodes a component of SCF complexes, which are composed of
        this protein, cullin 1, a ring-box protein, and one member of the F-box family
        of proteins. This protein binds directly to the F-box motif found in F-box
        proteins. SCF complexes are involved in the regulated ubiquitination of specific
        protein substrates, which targets them for degradation by the proteosome.
        Specific F-box proteins recognize different target protein(s), and many specific
        SCF substrates have been identified including regulators of cell cycle progression
        and development. Studies have also characterized the protein as an RNA polymerase
        II elongation facto...


        NOTCH2: This gene encodes a member of the Notch family. Members of this Type
        1 transmembrane protein family share structural characteristics including
        an extracellular domain consisting of multiple epidermal growth factor-like
        (EGF) repeats, and an intracellular domain consisting of multiple, different
        domain types. Notch family members play a role in a variety of developmental
        processes by controlling cell fate decisions. The Notch signaling network
        is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular signaling pathway which regulates
        interactions between physically adjacent cells. In Drosophilia, notch interaction
        with its cell-bound ligands (delta, serrate) establishes an intercellular
        signaling pathway that plays a key role in development. Homologues of the
        notch-ligands have also been identified in human, but precise interactions
        between these ligands and the human notch homologues remain to be determined.
        This protein is cleaved in the trans-Golgi network, and presented on the cell
        surface as a hete...


        FZD7: Members of the ''frizzled'' gene family encode 7-transmembrane domain
        proteins that are receptors for Wnt signaling proteins.  The FZD7 protein
        contains an N-terminal signal sequence, 10 cysteine residues typical of the
        cysteine-rich extracellular domain of Fz family members, 7 putative transmembrane
        domains, and an intracellular C-terminal tail with a PDZ domain-binding motif.  FZD7
        gene expression may downregulate APC function and enhance be...


        KAT2A: KAT2A, or GCN5, is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that functions
        primarily as a transcriptional activator. It also functions as a repressor
        of NF-kappa-B (see MIM 164011) by promoting ubiquitination of the NF-kappa-B
        subunit RELA (MIM 164014) in a HAT-independent mann...

        Here are the gene summaries:



        PRKCA: Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine- and threonine-specific
        protein kinases that can be activated by calcium and the second messenger
        diacylglycerol. PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein
        targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways.
        PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class
        of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression
        profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded
        by this gene is one of the PKC family members. This kinase has been reported
        to play roles in many different cellular processes, such as cell adhesion,
        cell transformation, cell cycle checkpoint, and cell v...

        of structurally related genes which encode secreted signaling proteins. These
        proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis and in several developmental
        processes, including regulation of cell fate and patterning during embryogenesis.
        Alternatively spliced tr...


        HES1: This protein belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription
        factors. It is a transcriptional repressor of genes that require a bHLH protein
        for their transcription. The protein has a particular type of basic domain
        that contains a helix interrupting protein that binds to t...


        FBXW11: This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family which is characterized
        by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F-box. The F-box proteins constitute
        one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box),
        which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins
        are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing
        leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein
        interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this
        gene belongs to the Fbws class and, in addition to an F-box, contains multiple
        WD40 repeats. This gene contains ...


        CCND1: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin
        family, whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein
        abundance throughout the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK
        kinases. Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns
        which contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This
        cyclin forms a complex with and functions as a regulatory subunit of CDK4
        or CDK6, whose activity is required for cell cycle G1/S transition. This protein
        has been shown to interact with tumor suppressor protein Rb and the expression
        of this gene is regulated positively by Rb. Mutations, a...


        CUL1: Predicted to enable ubiquitin protein ligase binding activity and ubiquitin-protein
        transferase activity. Involved in SCF-dependent proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent
        protein catabolic process and protein ubiquitination. Located in plasma membrane.
        Part of Parkin-FBXW7-Cul1 ubiquitin ligase complex and SCF u...


        DLL1: DLL1 is a human homolog of the Notch Delta ligand and is a member of
        the delta/serrate/jagged family.  It plays a role in mediating cell fate decisions
        during hematopoiesis. It may play a role in cell-to...


        SAP30: Histone acetylation plays a key role in the regulation of eukaryotic
        gene expression. Histone acetylation and deacetylation are catalyzed by multisubunit
        complexes. The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the histone
        deacetylase complex, which includes SIN3, SAP18, HDAC1, HDAC2, RbAp46, RbAp48,
        and other polypeptides. This complex is active in deacetylating core histone
        octamers, but inactive in deacetylating ...


        PSEN2: Alzheimer''s disease (AD) patients with an inherited form of the disease
        carry mutations in the presenilin proteins (PSEN1 or PSEN2) or the amyloid
        precursor protein (APP). These disease-linked mutations result in increased
        production of the longer form of amyloid-beta (main component of amyloid deposits
        found in AD brains). Presenilins are postulated to regulate APP processing
        through their effects on gamma-secretase, an enzyme that cleaves APP. Also,
        it is thought that the presenilins are involved in the cleavage of the Notch
        receptor such that, they either directly regulate gamma-secretase activity,
        or themselves act ...


        DTX1: Studies in Drosophila have identified this gene as encoding a positive
        regulator of the Notch-signaling pathway. The human gene encodes a protein
        of unknown function; however, it may play a role in basic helix-loop-helix
        tran...


        PPARD: This gene encodes a member of the peroxisome proliferator-activated
        receptor (PPAR) family. The encoded protein is thought to function as an integrator
        of transcriptional repression and nuclear receptor signaling. It may inhibit
        the ligand-induced transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator activated
        receptors alpha and gamma, though evidence for this effect is inconsistent.
        Expression of this gene in colorectal cancer cells may be variable but is
        typically relatively low. Knockout studies in mice suggested a role for this
        protein in myelination of the corpus callosum, lipid metabolism, differentiation,
        and e...


        NOTCH1: This gene encodes a member of the NOTCH family of proteins. Members
        of this Type I transmembrane protein family share structural characteristics
        including an extracellular domain consisting of multiple epidermal growth
        factor-like (EGF) repeats, and an intracellular domain consisting of multiple
        different domain types. Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular
        signaling pathway that regulates interactions between physically adjacent
        cells through binding of Notch family receptors to their cognate ligands.
        The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed in the trans-Golgi
        network to generate two polypeptide chains that heterodimerize to form the
        mature cell-surface receptor. This receptor plays a role in the development
        of numerous cell and tissue types. Mutations in this gene a...


        APH1A: This gene encodes a component of the gamma secretase complex that cleaves
        integral membrane proteins such as Notch receptors and beta-amyloid precursor
        protein. The gamma secretase complex contains this gene product, or the paralogous
        anterior pharynx defective 1 homolog B (APH1B), along with the presenilin,
        nicastrin, and presenilin enhancer-2 proteins. The precise function of this
        seven-transmembrane-domain protein is unknown though it is suspected of facilitating
        the association of nicastrin and presenilin in the gamma secretase complex
        as well as interacting with substrates of the gamma secretase complex prior
        to their proteolytic processing. Polymorphisms in a promoter region of this
        gene have been associated with an incre...


        FZD1: Members of the ''frizzled'' gene family encode 7-transmembrane domain
        proteins that are receptors for Wnt signaling proteins.  The FZD1 protein
        contains a signal peptide, a cysteine-rich domain in the N-terminal extracellular
        region, 7 transmembrane domains, and a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif.  The
        FZ...


        WNT5A: The WNT gene family consists of structurally related genes which encode
        secreted signaling proteins. These proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis
        and in several developmental processes, including regulation of cell fate
        and patterning during embryogenesis. This gene encodes a member of the WNT
        family that signals through both the canonical and non-canonical WNT pathways.
        This protein is a ligand for the seven transmembrane receptor frizzled-5 and
        the tyrosine kinase orphan receptor 2. This protein plays an essential role
        in regulating developmental pathways during embryogenesis. This protein may
        also play a role in oncogenesis. Mutat...


        LFNG: This gene is a member of the glycosyltransferase 31 gene family. Members
        of this gene family, which also includes the MFNG (GeneID: 4242) and RFNG
        (GeneID: 5986) genes, encode evolutionarily conserved glycosyltransferases
        that act in the Notch signaling pathway to define boundaries during embryonic
        development. While their genomic structure is distinct from other glycosyltransferases,
        these proteins have a fucose-specific beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase
        activity that leads to elongation of O-linked fucose residues on Notch, which
        alters Notch signaling. The protein encoded by this gene is predicted to be
        a single-pass type II Golgi membrane protein but it may also be secreted and
        proteolytically processed like the re...


        FZD5: Members of the ''frizzled'' gene family encode 7-transmembrane domain
        proteins that are receptors for Wnt signaling proteins.  The FZD5 protein
        is believed to be the receptor for the...


        RBX1: This locus encodes a RING finger-like domain-containing protein. The
        encoded protein interacts with cullin proteins and likely plays a role in
        ubiquitination processes necessary for cell cycle progression. This protein
        may also affect protein turnover. Related pseu...


        PSENEN: Presenilins, which are components of the gamma-secretase protein complex,
        are required for intramembranous processing of some type I transmembrane proteins,
        such as the Notch proteins and the beta-amyloid precursor protein. Signaling
        by Notch receptors mediates a wide range of developmental cell fates. Processing
        of the beta-amyloid precursor protein generates neurotoxic amyloid beta peptides,
        the major component of senile plaques associated with Alzheimer''s disease.
        This gene encodes a protein that is required for Notch pathway signaling,
        and for the activity and accumulation of gamma-secretase. Mutations resulting
        in haploin...


        ST3GAL6: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the sialyltransferase
        family. Members of this family are enzymes that transfer sialic acid from
        the activated cytidine 5''-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid to terminal
        positions on sialylated glycolipids (gangliosides) or to the N- or O-linked
        sugar chains of glycoproteins. This protein has high specificity for neolactotetraosylceramide
        and neolactohexaosylceramide as glycolipid substrates and may contribute to
        the formation of selectin ligands and s...


        JAG1: The jagged 1 protein encoded by JAG1 is the human homolog of the Drosophilia
        jagged protein. Human jagged 1 is the ligand for the receptor notch 1, the
        latter is involved in signaling processes. Mutations that alter the jagged
        1 protein cause Alagille syndrome. Jagged 1 signalling through notch 1 has
        al...


        DTX2: DTX2 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Takeyama et al., 2003 [PubMed
        12670957]).[supp...


        HEYL: This gene encodes a member of the hairy and enhancer of split-related
        (HESR) family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type transcription factors.
        The sequence of the encoded protein contains a conserved bHLH and orange domain,
        but its YRPW motif has diverged from other HESR family members. It is thought
        to be an effector of Notch signaling and a regulator of cell fate decisions.
        Alternatively spliced transcript varian...


        ARRB1: Members of arrestin/beta-arrestin protein family are thought to participate
        in agonist-mediated desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors and cause
        specific dampening of cellular responses to stimuli such as hormones, neurotransmitters,
        or sensory signals. Arrestin beta 1 is a cytosolic protein and acts as a cofactor
        in the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (BARK) mediated desensitization of
        beta-adrenergic receptors. Besides the central nervous system, it is expressed
        at high levels in peripheral blood leukocytes, and thus the BARK/beta-arrestin
        system is believed to play a major role in regulating receptor-med...


        SKP1: This gene encodes a component of SCF complexes, which are composed of
        this protein, cullin 1, a ring-box protein, and one member of the F-box family
        of proteins. This protein binds directly to the F-box motif found in F-box
        proteins. SCF complexes are involved in the regulated ubiquitination of specific
        protein substrates, which targets them for degradation by the proteosome.
        Specific F-box proteins recognize different target protein(s), and many specific
        SCF substrates have been identified including regulators of cell cycle progression
        and development. Studies have also characterized the protein as an RNA polymerase
        II elongation facto...


        NOTCH2: This gene encodes a member of the Notch family. Members of this Type
        1 transmembrane protein family share structural characteristics including
        an extracellular domain consisting of multiple epidermal growth factor-like
        (EGF) repeats, and an intracellular domain consisting of multiple, different
        domain types. Notch family members play a role in a variety of developmental
        processes by controlling cell fate decisions. The Notch signaling network
        is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular signaling pathway which regulates
        interactions between physically adjacent cells. In Drosophilia, notch interaction
        with its cell-bound ligands (delta, serrate) establishes an intercellular
        signaling pathway that plays a key role in development. Homologues of the
        notch-ligands have also been identified in human, but precise interactions
        between these ligands and the human notch homologues remain to be determined.
        This protein is cleaved in the trans-Golgi network, and presented on the cell
        surface as a hete...


        FZD7: Members of the ''frizzled'' gene family encode 7-transmembrane domain
        proteins that are receptors for Wnt signaling proteins.  The FZD7 protein
        contains an N-terminal signal sequence, 10 cysteine residues typical of the
        cysteine-rich extracellular domain of Fz family members, 7 putative transmembrane
        domains, and an intracellular C-terminal tail with a PDZ domain-binding motif.  FZD7
        gene expression may downregulate APC function and enhance be...


        KAT2A: KAT2A, or GCN5, is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that functions
        primarily as a transcriptional activator. It also functions as a repressor
        of NF-kappa-B (see MIM 164011) by promoting ubiquitination of the NF-kappa-B
        subunit RELA (MIM 164014) in a HAT-independent mann...

        complexes. The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the histone
        deacetylase complex, which includes SIN3, SAP18, HDAC1, HDAC2, RbAp46, RbAp48,
        and other polypeptides. This complex is active in deacetylating core histone
        octamers, but inactive in deacetylating ...


        PSEN2: Alzheimer''s disease (AD) patients with an inherited form of the disease
        carry mutations in the presenilin proteins (PSEN1 or PSEN2) or the amyloid
        precursor protein (APP). These disease-linked mutations result in increased
        production of the longer form of amyloid-beta (main component of amyloid deposits
        found in AD brains). Presenilins are postulated to regulate APP processing
        through their effects on gamma-secretase, an enzyme that cleaves APP. Also,
        it is thought that the presenilins are involved in the cleavage of the Notch
        receptor such that, they either directly regulate gamma-secretase activity,
        or themselves act ...


        DTX1: Studies in Drosophila have identified this gene as encoding a positive
        regulator of the Notch-signaling pathway. The human gene encodes a protein
        of unknown function; however, it may play a role in basic helix-loop-helix
        tran...


        PPARD: This gene encodes a member of the peroxisome proliferator-activated
        receptor (PPAR) family. The encoded protein is thought to function as an integrator
        of transcriptional repression and nuclear receptor signaling. It may inhibit
        the ligand-induced transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator activated
        receptors alpha and gamma, though evidence for this effect is inconsistent.
        Expression of this gene in colorectal cancer cells may be variable but is
        typically relatively low. Knockout studies in mice suggested a role for this
        protein in myelination of the corpus callosum, lipid metabolism, differentiation,
        and e...


        NOTCH1: This gene encodes a member of the NOTCH family of proteins. Members
        of this Type I transmembrane protein family share structural characteristics
        including an extracellular domain consisting of multiple epidermal growth
        factor-like (EGF) repeats, and an intracellular domain consisting of multiple
        different domain types. Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular
        signaling pathway that regulates interactions between physically adjacent
        cells through binding of Notch family receptors to their cognate ligands.
        The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed in the trans-Golgi
        network to generate two polypeptide chains that heterodimerize to form the
        mature cell-surface receptor. This receptor plays a role in the development
        of numerous cell and tissue types. Mutations in this gene a...


        APH1A: This gene encodes a component of the gamma secretase complex that cleaves
        integral membrane proteins such as Notch receptors and beta-amyloid precursor
        protein. The gamma secretase complex contains this gene product, or the paralogous
        anterior pharynx defective 1 homolog B (APH1B), along with the presenilin,
        nicastrin, and presenilin enhancer-2 proteins. The precise function of this
        seven-transmembrane-domain protein is unknown though it is suspected of facilitating
        the association of nicastrin and presenilin in the gamma secretase complex
        as well as interacting with substrates of the gamma secretase complex prior
        to their proteolytic processing. Polymorphisms in a promoter region of this
        gene have been associated with an incre...


        FZD1: Members of the ''frizzled'' gene family encode 7-transmembrane domain
        proteins that are receptors for Wnt signaling proteins.  The FZD1 protein
        contains a signal peptide, a cysteine-rich domain in the N-terminal extracellular
        region, 7 transmembrane domains, and a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif.  The
        FZ...


        WNT5A: The WNT gene family consists of structurally related genes which encode
        secreted signaling proteins. These proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis
        and in several developmental processes, including regulation of cell fate
        and patterning during embryogenesis. This gene encodes a member of the WNT
        family that signals through both the canonical and non-canonical WNT pathways.
        This protein is a ligand for the seven transmembrane receptor frizzled-5 and
        the tyrosine kinase orphan receptor 2. This protein plays an essential role
        in regulating developmental pathways during embryogenesis. This protein may
        also play a role in oncogenesis. Mutat...


        LFNG: This gene is a member of the glycosyltransferase 31 gene family. Members
        of this gene family, which also includes the MFNG (GeneID: 4242) and RFNG
        (GeneID: 5986) genes, encode evolutionarily conserved glycosyltransferases
        that act in the Notch signaling pathway to define boundaries during embryonic
        development. While their genomic structure is distinct from other glycosyltransferases,
        these proteins have a fucose-specific beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase
        activity that leads to elongation of O-linked fucose residues on Notch, which
        alters Notch signaling. The protein encoded by this gene is predicted to be
        a single-pass type II Golgi membrane protein but it may also be secreted and
        proteolytically processed like the re...


        FZD5: Members of the ''frizzled'' gene family encode 7-transmembrane domain
        proteins that are receptors for Wnt signaling proteins.  The FZD5 protein
        is believed to be the receptor for the...


        RBX1: This locus encodes a RING finger-like domain-containing protein. The
        encoded protein interacts with cullin proteins and likely plays a role in
        ubiquitination processes necessary for cell cycle progression. This protein
        may also affect protein turnover. Related pseu...


        PSENEN: Presenilins, which are components of the gamma-secretase protein complex,
        are required for intramembranous processing of some type I transmembrane proteins,
        such as the Notch proteins and the beta-amyloid precursor protein. Signaling
        by Notch receptors mediates a wide range of developmental cell fates. Processing
        of the beta-amyloid precursor protein generates neurotoxic amyloid beta peptides,
        the major component of senile plaques associated with Alzheimer''s disease.
        This gene encodes a protein that is required for Notch pathway signaling,
        and for the activity and accumulation of gamma-secretase. Mutations resulting
        in haploin...


        ST3GAL6: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the sialyltransferase
        family. Members of this family are enzymes that transfer sialic acid from
        the activated cytidine 5''-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid to terminal
        positions on sialylated glycolipids (gangliosides) or to the N- or O-linked
        sugar chains of glycoproteins. This protein has high specificity for neolactotetraosylceramide
        and neolactohexaosylceramide as glycolipid substrates and may contribute to
        the formation of selectin ligands and s...


        JAG1: The jagged 1 protein encoded by JAG1 is the human homolog of the Drosophilia
        jagged protein. Human jagged 1 is the ligand for the receptor notch 1, the
        latter is involved in signaling processes. Mutations that alter the jagged
        1 protein cause Alagille syndrome. Jagged 1 signalling through notch 1 has
        al...


        DTX2: DTX2 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Takeyama et al., 2003 [PubMed
        12670957]).[supp...


        HEYL: This gene encodes a member of the hairy and enhancer of split-related
        (HESR) family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type transcription factors.
        The sequence of the encoded protein contains a conserved bHLH and orange domain,
        but its YRPW motif has diverged from other HESR family members. It is thought
        to be an effector of Notch signaling and a regulator of cell fate decisions.
        Alternatively spliced transcript varian...


        ARRB1: Members of arrestin/beta-arrestin protein family are thought to participate
        in agonist-mediated desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors and cause
        specific dampening of cellular responses to stimuli such as hormones, neurotransmitters,
        or sensory signals. Arrestin beta 1 is a cytosolic protein and acts as a cofactor
        in the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (BARK) mediated desensitization of
        beta-adrenergic receptors. Besides the central nervous system, it is expressed
        at high levels in peripheral blood leukocytes, and thus the BARK/beta-arrestin
        system is believed to play a major role in regulating receptor-med...


        SKP1: This gene encodes a component of SCF complexes, which are composed of
        this protein, cullin 1, a ring-box protein, and one member of the F-box family
        of proteins. This protein binds directly to the F-box motif found in F-box
        proteins. SCF complexes are involved in the regulated ubiquitination of specific
        protein substrates, which targets them for degradation by the proteosome.
        Specific F-box proteins recognize different target protein(s), and many specific
        SCF substrates have been identified including regulators of cell cycle progression
        and development. Studies have also characterized the protein as an RNA polymerase
        II elongation facto...


        NOTCH2: This gene encodes a member of the Notch family. Members of this Type
        1 transmembrane protein family share structural characteristics including
        an extracellular domain consisting of multiple epidermal growth factor-like
        (EGF) repeats, and an intracellular domain consisting of multiple, different
        domain types. Notch family members play a role in a variety of developmental
        processes by controlling cell fate decisions. The Notch signaling network
        is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular signaling pathway which regulates
        interactions between physically adjacent cells. In Drosophilia, notch interaction
        with its cell-bound ligands (delta, serrate) establishes an intercellular
        signaling pathway that plays a key role in development. Homologues of the
        notch-ligands have also been identified in human, but precise interactions
        between these ligands and the human notch homologues remain to be determined.
        This protein is cleaved in the trans-Golgi network, and presented on the cell
        surface as a hete...


        FZD7: Members of the ''frizzled'' gene family encode 7-transmembrane domain
        proteins that are receptors for Wnt signaling proteins.  The FZD7 protein
        contains an N-terminal signal sequence, 10 cysteine residues typical of the
        cysteine-rich extracellular domain of Fz family members, 7 putative transmembrane
        domains, and an intracellular C-terminal tail with a PDZ domain-binding motif.  FZD7
        gene expression may downregulate APC function and enhance be...


        KAT2A: KAT2A, or GCN5, is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that functions
        primarily as a transcriptional activator. It also functions as a repressor
        of NF-kappa-B (see MIM 164011) by promoting ubiquitination of the NF-kappa-B
        subunit RELA (MIM 164014) in a HAT-independent mann...
