        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

      summary: '

        This list of human genes was analysed in a term enrichment test. The test
        revealed that many of these genes were involved in a common pathway which
        supports normal cellular processes including DNA replication, transcription
        and gene expression, cell growth and differentiation, protein processing and
        trafficking. Furthermore, many of these genes were involved in bone morphogenesis
        and cancer-related pathways.


        Mechanism:

        The underlying biological mechanism likely involves a number of distinct pathways,
        each with its own mechanism of action. Common processes shared by many of
        these genes include DNA replication, translation, and post-translational modification.
        Additionally, several of these genes are involved in cell-cell adhesion and
        the control of cellular migration and matrix remodeling, indicating roles
        in tissue morphogenesis. Furthermore, many of these genes are involved in
        intracellular signaling and signaling pathways that are essential for the

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Mechanism: Signal transduction, gene expression and transport functions may
        occur as a result of interaction between proteins encoded by the genes, as
        well as interaction between nucleic acids such as DNA, RNA, and chromatin.
        This can be regulated by post-translational modifications such as methylation,
        phosphorylations, and acylation, as well as by binding of other proteins and
        ligands. Membrane proteins allow for communication between the cytoplasm and
        outside environment and facilitate the transport of molecules.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.


        Provide results in the format

        For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.


        Provide results in the format


        Summary: <high level summary>

        Mechanism: <mechanism>

        Enriched Terms: <term1>; <term2>; <term3>


        For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number
        the list.

        Always put the list of terms last, after mechanism, summary, or hypotheses.
