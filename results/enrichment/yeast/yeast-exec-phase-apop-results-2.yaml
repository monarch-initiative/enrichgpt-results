        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.


        Provide results in the format


        Summary: <high level summary>

        Mechanism: <mechanism>

        Enriched Terms: <term1>; <term2>; <term3>


        For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number
        the list.

        Always put the list of terms last, after mechanism, summary, or hypotheses.



        Here are the gene summaries:



        YBL055C: 3''-->5'' exonuclease and endonuclease with a possible role in apoptosis;
        has similarity to mammalian and C. elegans apoptotic nucleases

        Summary and enriched terms:'
      response_text: ' Based on the information provided, it appears that both YBL055C
        genes are involved in cutting and shearing DNA in a process known as apoptosis.
        Apoptosis is a form of cell death typically used to regulate the number of
        cells in a given tissue. Enriched terms include: apoptosis; nucleases; endonuclease;
        3''-->5'' exonuclease.


        Mechanism: Apoptosis is a regulated cell death pathway controlled by a variety
        of proteins, including YBL055C genes. These proteins function by cutting and
        shearing DNA and typically result in the fragmentation of the nucleus and
        other cell structures. This fragmentation reduces the size and complexity
        of the cell, allowing for the controlled and regulated death of the cell.'
