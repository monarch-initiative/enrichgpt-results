        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        finger motifs, interaction with cellular retinol-binding proteins, hormone-dependent
        transcription, receptor-dependent transcription, nuclear hormone receptor-dependent
        transcription, transcriptional coactivator complex recruitment, chromatin
        remodeling complex formation, and transcriptional activator complex formation.
        The mechanism likely involves the formation of heterodimers, protein complexes,
        and chromatin regulators.

        Here are the gene summaries:



        CBFB: The protein encoded by this gene is the beta subunit of a heterodimeric
        core-binding transcription factor belonging to the PEBP2/CBF transcription
        factor family which master-regulates a host of genes specific to hematopoiesis
        (e.g., RUNX1) and osteogenesis (e.g., RUNX2). The beta subunit is a non-DNA
        binding regulatory subunit; it allosterically enhances DNA binding by alpha
        subunit as the complex binds to the core site of various enhancers and promoters,
        including murine leukemia virus, polyomavirus enhancer, T-cell receptor enhancers
        and GM-CSF promoters. Alternative splicing generates two mRNA variants, each
        encoding a distinct carboxyl terminus. In some cases, a pericentric inversion
        of chromosome ...


        SOX9: The protein encoded by this gene recognizes the sequence CCTTGAG along
        with other members of the HMG-box class DNA-binding proteins. It acts during
        chondrocyte differentiation and, with steroidogenic factor 1, regulates transcription

        MTA1: This gene encodes a protein that was identified in a screen for genes
        expressed in metastatic cells, specifically, mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines.
        Expression of this gene has been correlated with the metastatic potential
        of at least two types of carcinomas although it is also expressed in many
        normal tissues. The role it plays in metastasis is unclear. It was initially
        thought to be the 70kD component of a nucleosome remodeling deacetylase complex,
        NuRD, but it is more likely that this component is a different but very similar
        protein. These two proteins are so closely related, though, that they share

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
