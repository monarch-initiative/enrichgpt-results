        ATP2B1: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the family of P-type primary
        ion transport ATPases characterized by the formation of an aspartyl phosphate
        intermediate during the reaction cycle. These enzymes remove bivalent calcium
        ions from eukaryotic cells against very large concentration gradients and
        play a critical role in intracellular calcium homeostasis. The mammalian plasma
        membrane calcium ATPase isoforms are encoded by at least four separate genes
        and the diversity of these enzymes is further increased by alternative splicing
        of transcripts. The expression of different isoforms and splice variants is

        CACNA1C: This gene encodes an alpha-1 subunit of a voltage-dependent calcium
        channel. Calcium channels mediate the influx of calcium ions into the cell
        upon membrane polarization. The alpha-1 subunit consists of 24 transmembrane
        segments and forms the pore through which ions pass into the cell. The calcium
        channel consists of a complex of alpha-1, alpha-2/delta, beta, and gamma subunits
        in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. There are multiple isoforms of each of these proteins,
        either encoded by different genes or the result of alternative splicing of
        transcripts. The protein encoded by this gene binds to and is inhibited by
        dihydropyridine. Alternative splicing results in ...


        CACNG2: The protein encoded by this gene is a type I transmembrane AMPA receptor
        regulatory protein (TARP). TARPs regulate both trafficking and channel gating
        of the AMPA receptors. The AMPA subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors
        are ligand gated ion channels that are typically activated by glutamate released
        from presynaptic neuron terminals and mediate fast neurotransmission in excitatory
        synapses. TARPs thus play an important role in synaptic plasticity, learning
        and m...

        CHRNA7: The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are members of a superfamily
        of ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast signal transmission at synapses.
        The nAChRs are thought to be hetero-pentamers composed of homologous subunits.
        The proposed structure for each subunit is a conserved N-terminal extracellular
        domain followed by three conserved transmembrane domains, a variable cytoplasmic
        loop, a fourth conserved transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal extracellular
        region. The protein encoded by this gene forms a homo-oligomeric channel,
        displays marked permeability to calcium ions and is a major component of brain
        nicotinic receptors that are blocked by, and highly sensitive to, alpha-bungarotoxin.
        Once this receptor binds acetylcholine, it undergoes an extensive change in
        conformation that affects all subunits and leads to opening of an ion-conducting
        channel across the plasma membrane. This gene is located in a region identified

        to the functional...


        GRIN2A: This gene encodes a member of the glutamate-gated ion channel protein
        family. The encoded protein is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit.
        NMDA receptors are both ligand-gated and voltage-dependent, and are involved
        in long-term potentiation, an activity-dependent increase in the efficiency
        of synaptic transmission thought to underlie certain kinds of memory and learning.
        These receptors are permeable to calcium ions, and activation results in a
        calcium influx into post-synaptic cells, which results in the activation of
        several signaling cascades. Disruption of this gene is associated with focal
        epil...


        GRIN2B: This gene encodes a member of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
        family within the ionotropic glutamate receptor superfamily. The encoded protein
        is a subunit of the NMDA receptor ion channel which acts as an agonist binding
        site for glutamate. The NMDA receptors mediate a slow calcium-permeable component
        of excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The NMDA
        receptors are heterotetramers of seven genetically encoded, differentially
        expressed subunits including NR1 (GRIN1), NR2 (GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, or
        GRIN2D) and NR3 (GRIN3A or GRIN3B). The early expression of this gene in development
        suggests a role in brain development, circuit formation, synaptic plasticity,

        GRIN2C: This gene encodes a subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor,
        which is a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptor. NMDA receptors are found
        in the central nervous system, are permeable to cations and have an important
        role in physiological processes such as learning, memory, and synaptic development.
        The receptor is a tetramer of different subunits (typically heterodimer of
        subunit 1 with one or more of subunits 2A-D), forming a channel that is permeable
        to calcium, potassium, and sodium, and whose properties are determined by
        subunit composition. Alterations in the subunit composition of the receptor
        are associated with pathophysiological conditions such...


        GRIN2D: N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are a class of ionotropic glutamate
        receptors. NMDA channel has been shown to be involved in long-term potentiation,

        to schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and are also associated
        with response to the antidepressant citalopram in patients with major depressive
        disorder (MDD). MDD patients who also have a mutation in intron 2 of this
        gene show a significantly reduced response to citalopram as this antidepressant
        downregulates expression of this ...

        ataxia type 15, a disease associated with an heterogeneous group of cerebellar
        disorders. Multiple ...


        NCS1: This gene is a member of the neuronal calcium sensor gene family, which
        encode calcium-binding proteins expressed predominantly in neurons. The protein
        encoded by this gene regulates G protein-coupled receptor phosphorylation
        in a calcium-dependent manner and can substitute for calmodulin. The protein
        is associated with secretory granules and modulates synaptic transmission
        and synaptic plasticity. Multiple trans...


        P2RX4: The product of this gene belongs to the family of purinoceptors for
        ATP. This receptor functions as a ligand-gated ion channel with high calcium
        permeability. The main pharmacological distinction between the members of
        the purinoceptor family is the relative sensitivity to the antagonists suramin
        and PPADS. The product of this gene has the lowest sensitivity for these antagonists.
        Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants, ...


        P2RX7: The product of this gene belongs to the family of purinoceptors for
        ATP. This receptor functions as a ligand-gated ion channel and is responsible
        for ATP-dependent lysis of macrophages through the formation of membrane pores
        permeable to large molecules. Activation of this nuclear receptor by ATP in
        the cytoplasm may be a mechanism by which cellular activity can be coupled
        to changes in gene expression. Multiple alternatively spliced variant...


        PLCB1: The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the formation of inositol
        1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.

        PSEN1: Alzheimer''s disease (AD) patients with an inherited form of the disease
        carry mutations in the presenilin proteins (PSEN1; PSEN2) or in the amyloid
        precursor protein (APP). These disease-linked mutations result in increased
        production of the longer form of amyloid-beta (main component of amyloid deposits
        found in AD brains). Presenilins are postulated to regulate APP processing
        through their effects on gamma-secretase, an enzyme that cleaves APP. Also,
        it is thought that the presenilins are involved in the cleavage of the Notch
        receptor, such that they either directly regulate gamma-secretase activity
        or themselves are protease enzymes. Several alternatively spliced tr...


        SLC8A1: In cardiac myocytes, Ca(2+) concentrations alternate between high
        levels during contraction and low levels during relaxation. The increase in
        Ca(2+) concentration during contraction is primarily due to release of Ca(2+)
        from intracellular stores. However, some Ca(2+) also enters the cell through
        the sarcolemma (plasma membrane). During relaxation, Ca(2+) is sequestered
        within the intracellular stores. To prevent overloading of intracellular stores,
        the Ca(2+) that entered across the sarcolemma must be extruded from the cell.
        The Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger is the primary mechanism by which the Ca(2+) is
        extruded from the cell during relaxation. In the heart, the exchanger may
        play a k...

        regulation of action potential firing pattern; and...


        SLC8A3: This gene encodes a member of the sodium/calcium exchanger integral
        membrane protein family. Na+/Ca2+ exchange proteins are involved in maintaining
        Ca2+ homeostasis in a wide variety of cell types. The protein is regulated
        by intracellular calcium ions and is found in both the plasma membrane and
        intracellular organellar membranes, where exchange of Na+ for Ca2+ occurs
        in an electrogenic manner. Alternative splicing ...


        TRPV1: Capsaicin, the main pungent ingredient in hot chili peppers, elicits
        a sensation of burning pain by selectively activating sensory neurons that
        convey information about noxious stimuli to the central nervous system. The
        protein encoded by this gene is a receptor for capsaicin and is a non-selective
        cation channel that is structurally related to members of the TRP family of
        ion channels. This receptor is also activated by increases in temperature
        in the noxious range, suggesting that it functions as a transducer of painful
        thermal stimuli in vivo. Four transc...

        ATP2B1: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the family of P-type primary
        ion transport ATPases characterized by the formation of an aspartyl phosphate
        intermediate during the reaction cycle. These enzymes remove bivalent calcium
        ions from eukaryotic cells against very large concentration gradients and

        CACNA1C: This gene encodes an alpha-1 subunit of a voltage-dependent calcium
        channel. Calcium channels mediate the influx of calcium ions into the cell
        upon membrane polarization. The alpha-1 subunit consists of 24 transmembrane
        segments and forms the pore through which ions pass into the cell. The calcium
        channel consists of a complex of alpha-1, alpha-2/delta, beta, and gamma subunits
        in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. There are multiple isoforms of each of these proteins,
        either encoded by different genes or the result of alternative splicing of

        dihydropyridine. Alternative splicing results in ...


        CACNG2: The protein encoded by this gene is a type I transmembrane AMPA receptor
        regulatory protein (TARP). TARPs regulate both trafficking and channel gating

        are ligand gated ion channels that are typically activated by glutamate released
        from presynaptic neuron terminals and mediate fast neurotransmission in excitatory
        synapses. TARPs thus play an important role in synaptic plasticity, learning
        and m...

        CHRNA7: The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are members of a superfamily
        of ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast signal transmission at synapses.
        The nAChRs are thought to be hetero-pentamers composed of homologous subunits.
        The proposed structure for each subunit is a conserved N-terminal extracellular
        domain followed by three conserved transmembrane domains, a variable cytoplasmic
        loop, a fourth conserved transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal extracellular
        region. The protein encoded by this gene forms a homo-oligomeric channel,
        displays marked permeability to calcium ions and is a major component of brain
        nicotinic receptors that are blocked by, and highly sensitive to, alpha-bungarotoxin.
        Once this receptor binds acetylcholine, it undergoes an extensive change in
        conformation that affects all subunits and leads to opening of an ion-conducting
        channel across the plasma membrane. This gene is located in a region identified
        as a major susceptibility locus for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and a chromosomal
        location involved in the genetic ...

        in physiological and pathological processes in the central nervous system.
        This subunit shows greater than 90% identity to the corresponding subunit
        in rat. Studies in the knockout mouse deficient in this subunit suggest that
        this gene may be involved in t...


        GRIN3B: The protein encoded by this gene is a subunit of an N-methyl-D-aspartate
        (NMDA) receptor. The encoded protein is found primarily in motor neurons,
        where it forms a heterotetramer with GRIN1 to create an excitatory glycine
        receptor. Variations in this gene have been pr...


        HTR2A: This gene encodes one of the receptors for serotonin, a neurotransmitter
        with many roles. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility
        to schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and are also associated
        with response to the antidepressant citalopram in patients with major depressive
        disorder (MDD). MDD patients who also have a mutation in intron 2 of this
        gene show a significantly reduced response to citalopram as this antidepressant
        downregulates expression of this ...


        ITPR1: This gene encodes an intracellular receptor for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.
        Upon stimulation by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, this receptor mediates calcium
        release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutations in this gene cause spinocerebellar
        ataxia type 15, a disease associated with an heterogeneous group of cerebellar
        disorders. Multiple ...


        NCS1: This gene is a member of the neuronal calcium sensor gene family, which
        encode calcium-binding proteins expressed predominantly in neurons. The protein
        encoded by this gene regulates G protein-coupled receptor phosphorylation
        in a calcium-dependent manner and can substitute for calmodulin. The protein
        is associated with secretory granules and modulates synaptic transmission
        and synaptic plasticity. Multiple trans...


        P2RX4: The product of this gene belongs to the family of purinoceptors for
        ATP. This receptor functions as a ligand-gated ion channel with high calcium
        permeability. The main pharmacological distinction between the members of
        the purinoceptor family is the relative sensitivity to the antagonists suramin
        and PPADS. The product of this gene has the lowest sensitivity for these antagonists.
        Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants, ...


        P2RX7: The product of this gene belongs to the family of purinoceptors for
        ATP. This receptor functions as a ligand-gated ion channel and is responsible
        for ATP-dependent lysis of macrophages through the formation of membrane pores
        permeable to large molecules. Activation of this nuclear receptor by ATP in
        the cytoplasm may be a mechanism by which cellular activity can be coupled
        to changes in gene expression. Multiple alternatively spliced variant...


        PLCB1: The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the formation of inositol
        1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.
        This reaction uses calcium as a cofactor and plays an important role in the
        intracellular transduction of many extracellular signals. This gene is activated
        by two G-protein alpha subunits, alpha-q and alpha-11. Two transcript va...


        PSEN1: Alzheimer''s disease (AD) patients with an inherited form of the disease
        carry mutations in the presenilin proteins (PSEN1; PSEN2) or in the amyloid
        precursor protein (APP). These disease-linked mutations result in increased
        production of the longer form of amyloid-beta (main component of amyloid deposits
        found in AD brains). Presenilins are postulated to regulate APP processing
        through their effects on gamma-secretase, an enzyme that cleaves APP. Also,
        it is thought that the presenilins are involved in the cleavage of the Notch
        receptor, such that they either directly regulate gamma-secretase activity
        or themselves are protease enzymes. Several alternatively spliced tr...


        SLC8A1: In cardiac myocytes, Ca(2+) concentrations alternate between high
        levels during contraction and low levels during relaxation. The increase in
        Ca(2+) concentration during contraction is primarily due to release of Ca(2+)
        from intracellular stores. However, some Ca(2+) also enters the cell through
        the sarcolemma (plasma membrane). During relaxation, Ca(2+) is sequestered
        within the intracellular stores. To prevent overloading of intracellular stores,
        the Ca(2+) that entered across the sarcolemma must be extruded from the cell.
        The Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger is the primary mechanism by which the Ca(2+) is
        extruded from the cell during relaxation. In the heart, the exchanger may
        play a k...


        SLC8A2: Predicted to enable calcium:cation antiporter activity involved in
        regulation of postsynaptic cytosolic calcium ion concentration and calcium:sodium
        antiporter activity. Predicted to be involved in several processes, including
        inorganic cation transmembrane transport; learning or memory; and regulation
        of short-term neuronal synaptic plasticity. Predicted to act upstream of or
        within several processes, including modulation of chemical synaptic transmission;
        regulation of action potential firing pattern; and...


        SLC8A3: This gene encodes a member of the sodium/calcium exchanger integral
        membrane protein family. Na+/Ca2+ exchange proteins are involved in maintaining
        Ca2+ homeostasis in a wide variety of cell types. The protein is regulated
        by intracellular calcium ions and is found in both the plasma membrane and
        intracellular organellar membranes, where exchange of Na+ for Ca2+ occurs
        in an electrogenic manner. Alternative splicing ...


        TRPV1: Capsaicin, the main pungent ingredient in hot chili peppers, elicits
        a sensation of burning pain by selectively activating sensory neurons that
        convey information about noxious stimuli to the central nervous system. The
        protein encoded by this gene is a receptor for capsaicin and is a non-selective
        cation channel that is structurally related to members of the TRP family of
        ion channels. This receptor is also activated by increases in temperature
        in the noxious range, suggesting that it functions as a transducer of painful
        thermal stimuli in vivo. Four transc...

        segments and forms the pore through which ions pass into the cell. The calcium
        channel consists of a complex of alpha-1, alpha-2/delta, beta, and gamma subunits
        in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. There are multiple isoforms of each of these proteins,
        either encoded by different genes or the result of alternative splic...

        CHRNA7: The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are members of a superfamily
        of ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast signal transmission at synapses.
        The nAChRs are thought to be hetero-pentamers composed of homologous subunits.
        The proposed structure for each subunit is a conserved N-terminal extracellular
        domain followed by three conserved transmembrane domains, a variable cytoplasmic
        loop, a fourth conserved transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal extracellular
        region. The protein encoded by this gene forms a homo-oligomeric channel,
        displays marked permeability to calcium ions and is a major component of brain
        nicotinic receptors that are blocked by, and highly sensitive to, alpha-bungarotoxin.
        Once this receptor binds acetylcholine, it undergoes an extensive change in
        conformation that affects all subunits and leads to opening o...

        this gene causes myoclonus dystonia; other mutations have been associated
        with schizophrenia. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript
        variants enco...


        F2R: Coagulation factor II receptor is a 7-transmembrane receptor involved

        and stem cell differentiation. Located in extra...


        GRIN1: The protein encoded by this gene is a critical subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate
        receptors, members of the glutamate receptor channel superfamily which are
        heteromeric protein complexes with multiple subunits arranged to form a ligand-gated
        ion channel. These subunits play a key role in the plasticity of synapses,
        which is believed to underlie memory and learning. Cell-specific factors...


        GRIN2A: This gene encodes a member of the glutamate-gated ion channel protein
        family. The encoded protein is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit.
        NMDA receptors are both ligand-gated and voltage-dependent, and are involved
        in long-term potentiation, an activity-dependent increase in the efficiency
        of synaptic transmission thought to underlie certain kinds of memory and learning.
        These receptors are permeable to calcium ions, and activation results in a
        calcium influx into post-synaptic...


        GRIN2B: This gene encodes a member of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
        family within the ionotropic glutamate receptor superfamily. The encoded protein
        is a subunit of the NMDA receptor ion channel which acts as an agonist binding
        site for glutamate. The NMDA receptors mediate a slow calcium-permeable component
        of excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The NMDA
        receptors are heterotetramers of seven genetically encoded, differentially
        expressed subunits including NR1 (GRIN1), NR2 (GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, or
        GRIN2D) and NR3 (GRIN3A or GRIN3B). The early expression of this gene in development
        su...


        GRIN2C: This gene encodes a subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor,
        which is a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptor. NMDA receptors are found
        in the central nervous system, are permeable to cations and have an important
        role in physiological processes such as learning, memory, and synaptic development.
        The receptor is a tetramer of different subunits (typically heterodimer of
        subunit 1 with one or more of subunits 2A-D), forming a channel that is permeable
        to calcium, potassium, and sodium, and whose properties are determine...


        GRIN2D: N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are a class of ionotropic glutamate
        receptors. NMDA channel has been shown to be involved in long-term potentiation,

        thought to underlie certain kinds of memory and learning. NMDA receptor channels
        are heteromers composed ...

        in rat. Studies in the kn...


        GRIN3B: The protein encoded by this gene is a subunit of an N-methyl-D-aspartate
        (NMDA) receptor. The encoded protein is found primarily in motor neurons,

        HTR2A: This gene encodes one of the receptors for serotonin, a neurotransmitter
        with many roles. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility
        to schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and are also associated
        with response to the antidepressant citalopram in patients with major depressive
        disorder (MDD). MDD patients who also have a mutation in intron 2 of this
        gene show a sig...

        encode calcium-binding proteins expressed predominantly in neurons. The protein
        encoded by this gene regulates G protein-coupled receptor phosphorylation
        in a calcium-dependent manner and can substitute for calmodulin. The protein
        is associated with secretory ...


        P2RX4: The product of this gene belongs to the family of purinoceptors for
        ATP. This receptor functions as a ligand-gated ion channel with high calcium
        permeability. The main pharmacological distinction between the members of
        the purinoceptor family is the relative sensitivity to the antagonists suramin
        and PPADS. The product of this gene has the lowest ...


        P2RX7: The product of this gene belongs to the family of purinoceptors for
        ATP. This receptor functions as a ligand-gated ion channel and is responsible
        for ATP-dependent lysis of macrophages through the formation of membrane pores
        permeable to large molecules. Activation of this nuclear receptor by ATP in
        the cytoplasm may be a mechanism by which cellular acti...


        PLCB1: The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the formation of inositol
        1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.

        intracellular transduction of many extracellular signals. This gene is activa...


        PSEN1: Alzheimer''s disease (AD) patients with an inherited form of the disease
        carry mutations in the presenilin proteins (PSEN1; PSEN2) or in the amyloid
        precursor protein (APP). These disease-linked mutations result in increased
        production of the longer form of amyloid-beta (main component of amyloid deposits
        found in AD brains). Presenilins are postulated to regulate APP processing
        through their effects on gamma-secretase, an enzyme that cleaves APP. Also,
        it is thought that the presenilins are involved in the cleavage of the Notch
        receptor...


        SLC8A1: In cardiac myocytes, Ca(2+) concentrations alternate between high
        levels during contraction and low levels during relaxation. The increase in
        Ca(2+) concentration during contraction is primarily due to release of Ca(2+)
        from intracellular stores. However, some Ca(2+) also enters the cell through
        the sarcolemma (plasma membrane). During relaxation, Ca(2+) is sequestered
        within the intracellular stores. To prevent overloading of intracellular stores,
        the Ca(2+) that entered across the sarcolemma must be extruded from the cell.
        The Na(+)-Ca(2+) ex...


        SLC8A2: Predicted to enable calcium:cation antiporter activity involved in

        a sensation of burning pain by selectively activating sensory neurons that
        convey information about noxious stimuli to the central nervous system. The
        protein encoded by this gene is a receptor for capsaicin and is a non-selective
        cation channel that is structurally related to members of the TRP family of
        ion channels. This receptor is also activated by increases in temperature

        ion transport ATPases characterized by the formation of an aspartyl phosphate
        intermediate during the reaction cycle. These enzymes remove bivalent calcium
        ions from eukaryotic cells against very large concentration gradients and
        play a critical role in intracellular calcium homeostasis. The mammalian plasma
        membrane calcium ATPase isoforms are encoded by at least four separate genes
        and the diversity of these enzymes is further increased by alternative splicing
        of transcripts. The expression of different isoforms and splice variants is

        segments and forms the pore through which ions pass into the cell. The calcium
        channel consists of a complex of alpha-1, alpha-2/delta, beta, and gamma subunits
        in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. There are multiple isoforms of each of these proteins,
        either encoded by different genes or the result of alternative splic...

        CHRNA7: The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are members of a superfamily
        of ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast signal transmission at synapses.
        The nAChRs are thought to be hetero-pentamers composed of homologous subunits.
        The proposed structure for each subunit is a conserved N-terminal extracellular
        domain followed by three conserved transmembrane domains, a variable cytoplasmic
        loop, a fourth conserved transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal extracellular
        region. The protein encoded by this gene forms a homo-oligomeric channel,
        displays marked permeability to calcium ions and is a major component of brain
        nicotinic receptors that are blocked by, and highly sensitive to, alpha-bungarotoxin.
        Once this receptor binds acetylcholine, it undergoes an extensive change in
        conformation that affects all subunits and leads to opening o...

        and stem cell differentiation. Located in extra...


        GRIN1: The protein encoded by this gene is a critical subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate
        receptors, members of the glutamate receptor channel superfamily which are
        heteromeric protein complexes with multiple subunits arranged to form a ligand-gated
        ion channel. These subunits play a key role in the plasticity of synapses,
        which is believed to underlie memory and learning. Cell-specific factors...


        GRIN2A: This gene encodes a member of the glutamate-gated ion channel protein
        family. The encoded protein is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit.
        NMDA receptors are both ligand-gated and voltage-dependent, and are involved
        in long-term potentiation, an activity-dependent increase in the efficiency
        of synaptic transmission thought to underlie certain kinds of memory and learning.
        These receptors are permeable to calcium ions, and activation results in a
        calcium influx into post-synaptic...


        GRIN2B: This gene encodes a member of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
        family within the ionotropic glutamate receptor superfamily. The encoded protein
        is a subunit of the NMDA receptor ion channel which acts as an agonist binding
        site for glutamate. The NMDA receptors mediate a slow calcium-permeable component
        of excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The NMDA
        receptors are heterotetramers of seven genetically encoded, differentially
        expressed subunits including NR1 (GRIN1), NR2 (GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, or
        GRIN2D) and NR3 (GRIN3A or GRIN3B). The early expression of this gene in development
        su...


        GRIN2C: This gene encodes a subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor,
        which is a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptor. NMDA receptors are found
        in the central nervous system, are permeable to cations and have an important
        role in physiological processes such as learning, memory, and synaptic development.
        The receptor is a tetramer of different subunits (typically heterodimer of
        subunit 1 with one or more of subunits 2A-D), forming a channel that is permeable
        to calcium, potassium, and sodium, and whose properties are determine...


        GRIN2D: N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are a class of ionotropic glutamate
        receptors. NMDA channel has been shown to be involved in long-term potentiation,
        an activity-dependent increase in the efficiency of synaptic transmission
        thought to underlie certain kinds of memory and learning. NMDA receptor channels
        are heteromers composed ...


        GRIN3A: This gene encodes a subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors,

        HTR2A: This gene encodes one of the receptors for serotonin, a neurotransmitter
        with many roles. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility
        to schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and are also associated
        with response to the antidepressant citalopram in patients with major depressive
        disorder (MDD). MDD patients who also have a mutation in intron 2 of this
        gene show a sig...

        release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutations in this gene cause spinocerebellar
        ataxia type 15, a disease asso...


        NCS1: This gene is a member of the neuronal calcium sensor gene family, which
        encode calcium-binding proteins expressed predominantly in neurons. The protein
        encoded by this gene regulates G protein-coupled receptor phosphorylation
        in a calcium-dependent manner and can substitute for calmodulin. The protein
        is associated with secretory ...


        P2RX4: The product of this gene belongs to the family of purinoceptors for
        ATP. This receptor functions as a ligand-gated ion channel with high calcium
        permeability. The main pharmacological distinction between the members of
        the purinoceptor family is the relative sensitivity to the antagonists suramin
        and PPADS. The product of this gene has the lowest ...


        P2RX7: The product of this gene belongs to the family of purinoceptors for
        ATP. This receptor functions as a ligand-gated ion channel and is responsible
        for ATP-dependent lysis of macrophages through the formation of membrane pores
        permeable to large molecules. Activation of this nuclear receptor by ATP in
        the cytoplasm may be a mechanism by which cellular acti...


        PLCB1: The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the formation of inositol
        1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.

        intracellular transduction of many extracellular signals. This gene is activa...


        PSEN1: Alzheimer''s disease (AD) patients with an inherited form of the disease
        carry mutations in the presenilin proteins (PSEN1; PSEN2) or in the amyloid
        precursor protein (APP). These disease-linked mutations result in increased
        production of the longer form of amyloid-beta (main component of amyloid deposits
        found in AD brains). Presenilins are postulated to regulate APP processing
        through their effects on gamma-secretase, an enzyme that cleaves APP. Also,
        it is thought that the presenilins are involved in the cleavage of the Notch
        receptor...


        SLC8A1: In cardiac myocytes, Ca(2+) concentrations alternate between high
        levels during contraction and low levels during relaxation. The increase in
        Ca(2+) concentration during contraction is primarily due to release of Ca(2+)
        from intracellular stores. However, some Ca(2+) also enters the cell through
        the sarcolemma (plasma membrane). During relaxation, Ca(2+) is sequestered
        within the intracellular stores. To prevent overloading of intracellular stores,
        the Ca(2+) that entered across the sarcolemma must be extruded from the cell.
        The Na(+)-Ca(2+) ex...


        SLC8A2: Predicted to enable calcium:cation antiporter activity involved in
        regulation of postsynaptic cytosolic calcium ion concentration and calcium:sodium
        antiporter activity. Predicted to be involved in several processes, including

        intracellular organellar membranes, wh...


        TRPV1: Capsaicin, the main pungent ingredient in hot chili peppers, elicits
        a sensation of burning pain by selectively activating sensory neurons that
        convey information about noxious stimuli to the central nervous system. The
        protein encoded by this gene is a receptor for capsaicin and is a non-selective
        cation channel that is structurally related to members of the TRP family of
        ion channels. This receptor is also activated by increases in temperature
        i...

        P2RX7: The product of this gene belongs to the family of purinoceptors for
        ATP. This receptor functions as a ligand-gated ion channel and is responsible
        for ATP-dependent lysis of macrophages through the formation of membrane pores
        permeable to large molecules. Activation of this nuclear receptor by ATP in
        the cytoplasm may be a mechanism by which cellular activity can be coupled
        to changes in gene expression. Multiple alternatively spliced variant...

        activity. Acts upstream of or within positive regulation of cytosolic calcium
        ion concentration. Predicted to be located in membrane. Predicted to be active
        in cholinergic synapse and neuron projection. Predicted to be integral component
        of postsynapt...


        GPM6A: Predicted to enable calcium channel activity. Involved in neuron migration
        and stem cell differentiation. Located in extracellular exosome. [provided
        by ...


        GRIN2A: This gene encodes a member of the glutamate-gated ion channel protein
        family. The encoded protein is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit.
        NMDA receptors are both ligand-gated and voltage-dependent, and are involved
        in long-term potentiation, an activity-dependent increase in the efficiency
        of synaptic transmission thought to underlie certain kinds of memory and learning.
        These receptors are permeable to calcium ions, and activation results in a
        calcium influx into post-synaptic cells, which results in the activation of
        several signaling cascades. Disruption of this gene is associated with focal
        epil...


        GRIN3A: This gene encodes a subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors,
        which belong to the superfamily of glutamate-regulated ion channels, and function
        in physiological and pathological processes in the central nervous system.
        This subunit shows greater than 90% identity to the corresponding subunit
        in rat. Studies in the knockout mouse deficient in this subunit suggest that
        this gene may be involved in t...


        CHRNA7: The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are members of a superfamily
        of ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast signal transmission at synapses.
        The nAChRs are thought to be hetero-pentamers composed of homologous subunits.
        The proposed structure for each subunit is a conserved N-terminal extracellular
        domain followed by three conserved transmembrane domains, a variable cytoplasmic
        loop, a fourth conserved transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal extracellular
        region. The protein encoded by this gene forms a homo-oligomeric channel,
        displays marked permeability to calcium ions and is a major component of brain
        nicotinic receptors that are blocked by, and highly sensitive to, alpha-bungarotoxin.
        Once this receptor binds acetylcholine, it undergoes an extensive change in
        conformation that affects all subunits and leads to opening of an ion-conducting
        channel across the plasma membrane. This gene is located in a region identified
        as a major susceptibility locus for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and a chromosomal
        location involved in the genetic ...


        CACNG4: The protein encoded by this gene is a type I transmembrane AMPA receptor
        regulatory protein (TARP). TARPs regulate both trafficking and channel gating
        of the AMPA receptors. This gene is part of a functionally diverse eight-member
        protein subfamily of the PMP-22/EMP/MP20 family and is located in a cluster
        with two family members,...


        P2RX4: The product of this gene belongs to the family of purinoceptors for
        ATP. This receptor functions as a ligand-gated ion channel with high calcium
        permeability. The main pharmacological distinction between the members of
        the purinoceptor family is the relative sensitivity to the antagonists suramin
        and PPADS. The product of this gene has the lowest sensitivity for these antagonists.
        Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants, ...


        ITPR1: This gene encodes an intracellular receptor for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.
        Upon stimulation by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, this receptor mediates calcium
        release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutations in this gene cause spinocerebellar
        ataxia type 15, a disease associated with an heterogeneous group of cerebellar
        disorders. Multiple ...


        F2R: Coagulation factor II receptor is a 7-transmembrane receptor involved
        in the regulation of thrombotic response. Proteolytic cleavage leads to the
        activation of the receptor. F2R is a G-protein coupled receptor family member.
        Alternative splicing results...


        ATP2B2: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the family of P-type primary
        ion transport ATPases characterized by the formation of an aspartyl phosphate
        intermediate during the reaction cycle. These enzymes remove bivalent calcium
        ions from eukaryotic cells against very large concentration gradients and
        play a critical role in intracellular calcium homeostasis. The mammalian plasma
        membrane calcium ATPase isoforms are encoded by at least four separate genes
        and the diversity of these enzymes is further increased by alternative splicing
        of transcripts. The expression of different isoforms and splice variants is
        regulated in a developmental, tissue- and cell type-specific manner, suggesting
        that these pumps are functionally adapted to the physiological needs of particular
        cells an...


        GRIN2D: N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are a class of ionotropic glutamate
        receptors. NMDA channel has been shown to be involved in long-term potentiation,
        an activity-dependent increase in the efficiency of synaptic transmission
        thought to underlie certain kinds of memory and learning. NMDA receptor channels
        are heteromers composed of the key receptor subunit NMDAR1 (GRIN1) and 1 or
        more of the 4 NMDAR2 subunits: N...


        CACNA1C: This gene encodes an alpha-1 subunit of a voltage-dependent calcium
        channel. Calcium channels mediate the influx of calcium ions into the cell
        upon membrane polarization. The alpha-1 subunit consists of 24 transmembrane
        segments and forms the pore through which ions pass into the cell. The calcium
        channel consists of a complex of alpha-1, alpha-2/delta, beta, and gamma subunits
        in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. There are multiple isoforms of each of these proteins,
        either encoded by different genes or the result of alternative splicing of
        transcripts. The protein encoded by this gene binds to and is inhibited by
        dihydropyridine. Alternative splicing results in ...


        SLC8A1: In cardiac myocytes, Ca(2+) concentrations alternate between high
        levels during contraction and low levels during relaxation. The increase in
        Ca(2+) concentration during contraction is primarily due to release of Ca(2+)
        from intracellular stores. However, some Ca(2+) also enters the cell through
        the sarcolemma (plasma membrane). During relaxation, Ca(2+) is sequestered
        within the intracellular stores. To prevent overloading of intracellular stores,
        the Ca(2+) that entered across the sarcolemma must be extruded from the cell.
        The Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger is the primary mechanism by which the Ca(2+) is
        extruded from the cell during relaxation. In the heart, the exchanger may
        play a k...

        protein subfamily of the PMP-22/EMP/MP20 family and is located in a cluster

        PSEN1: Alzheimer''s disease (AD) patients with an inherited form of the disease
        carry mutations in the presenilin proteins (PSEN1; PSEN2) or in the amyloid
        precursor protein (APP). These disease-linked mutations result in increased
        production of the longer form of amyloid-beta (main component of amyloid deposits
        found in AD brains). Presenilins are postulated to regulate APP processing
        through their effects on gamma-secretase, an enzyme that cleaves APP. Also,
        it is thought that the presenilins are involved in the cleavage of the Notch
        receptor, such that they either directly regulate gamma-secretase activity
        or themselves are protease enzymes. Several alternatively spliced tr...

        ion channel. These subunits play a key role in the plasticity of synapses,
        which is believed to underlie memory and learning. Cell-specific factors are

        GRIN2C: This gene encodes a subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor,
        which is a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptor. NMDA receptors are found
        in the central nervous system, are permeable to cations and have an important
        role in physiological processes such as learning, memory, and synaptic development.
        The receptor is a tetramer of different subunits (typically heterodimer of
        subunit 1 with one or more of subunits 2A-D), forming a channel that is permeable
        to calcium, potassium, and sodium, and whose properties are determined by
        subunit composition. Alterations in the subunit composition of the receptor
        are associated with pathophysiological conditions such...

        GRIN2B: This gene encodes a member of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
        family within the ionotropic glutamate receptor superfamily. The encoded protein
        is a subunit of the NMDA receptor ion channel which acts as an agonist binding
        site for glutamate. The NMDA receptors mediate a slow calcium-permeable component
        of excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The NMDA
        receptors are heterotetramers of seven genetically encoded, differentially
        expressed subunits including NR1 (GRIN1), NR2 (GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, or
        GRIN2D) and NR3 (GRIN3A or GRIN3B). The early expression of this gene in development
        suggests a role in brain development, circuit formation, synaptic plasticity,
        and cellular migration and differentiation. Naturally occurring mutations

        ATP2B1: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the family of P-type primary
        ion transport ATPases characterized by the formation of an aspartyl phosphate
        intermediate during the reaction cycle. These enzymes remove bivalent calcium
        ions from eukaryotic cells against very large concentration gradients and
        play a critical role in intracellular calcium homeostasis. The mammalian plasma
        membrane calcium ATPase isoforms are encoded by at least four separate genes
        and the diversity of these enzymes is further increased by alternative splicing
        of transcripts. The expression of different isoforms and splice variants is
        regulated in a developmental, tissue- and cell type-specific manner, suggesting

        P2RX7: The product of this gene belongs to the family of purinoceptors for
        ATP. This receptor functions as a ligand-gated ion channel and is responsible
        for ATP-dependent lysis of macrophages through the formation of membrane pores
        permeable to large molecules. Activation of this nuclear receptor by ATP in
        the cytoplasm may be a mechanism by which cellular activity can be coupled
        to changes in gene expression. Multiple alternatively spliced variant...

        activity. Acts upstream of or within positive regulation of cytosolic calcium
        ion concentration. Predicted to be located in membrane. Predicted to be active
        in cholinergic synapse and neuron projection. Predicted to be integral component
        of postsynapt...


        GPM6A: Predicted to enable calcium channel activity. Involved in neuron migration
        and stem cell differentiation. Located in extracellular exosome. [provided
        by ...


        GRIN2A: This gene encodes a member of the glutamate-gated ion channel protein
        family. The encoded protein is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit.
        NMDA receptors are both ligand-gated and voltage-dependent, and are involved
        in long-term potentiation, an activity-dependent increase in the efficiency
        of synaptic transmission thought to underlie certain kinds of memory and learning.
        These receptors are permeable to calcium ions, and activation results in a
        calcium influx into post-synaptic cells, which results in the activation of
        several signaling cascades. Disruption of this gene is associated with focal
        epil...


        GRIN3A: This gene encodes a subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors,
        which belong to the superfamily of glutamate-regulated ion channels, and function
        in physiological and pathological processes in the central nervous system.
        This subunit shows greater than 90% identity to the corresponding subunit
        in rat. Studies in the knockout mouse deficient in this subunit suggest that
        this gene may be involved in t...


        CHRNA7: The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are members of a superfamily
        of ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast signal transmission at synapses.
        The nAChRs are thought to be hetero-pentamers composed of homologous subunits.
        The proposed structure for each subunit is a conserved N-terminal extracellular
        domain followed by three conserved transmembrane domains, a variable cytoplasmic
        loop, a fourth conserved transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal extracellular
        region. The protein encoded by this gene forms a homo-oligomeric channel,
        displays marked permeability to calcium ions and is a major component of brain
        nicotinic receptors that are blocked by, and highly sensitive to, alpha-bungarotoxin.
        Once this receptor binds acetylcholine, it undergoes an extensive change in
        conformation that affects all subunits and leads to opening of an ion-conducting
        channel across the plasma membrane. This gene is located in a region identified
        as a major susceptibility locus for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and a chromosomal
        location involved in the genetic ...

        regulatory protein (TARP). TARPs regulate both trafficking and channel gating
        of the AMPA receptors. This gene is part of a functionally diverse eight-member
        protein subfamily of the PMP-22/EMP/MP20 family and is located in a cluster
        with two family members,...


        P2RX4: The product of this gene belongs to the family of purinoceptors for
        ATP. This receptor functions as a ligand-gated ion channel with high calcium
        permeability. The main pharmacological distinction between the members of
        the purinoceptor family is the relative sensitivity to the antagonists suramin
        and PPADS. The product of this gene has the lowest sensitivity for these antagonists.
        Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants, ...


        ITPR1: This gene encodes an intracellular receptor for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.
        Upon stimulation by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, this receptor mediates calcium
        release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutations in this gene cause spinocerebellar
        ataxia type 15, a disease associated with an heterogeneous group of cerebellar
        disorders. Multiple ...


        F2R: Coagulation factor II receptor is a 7-transmembrane receptor involved
        in the regulation of thrombotic response. Proteolytic cleavage leads to the
        activation of the receptor. F2R is a G-protein coupled receptor family member.

        cells an...


        GRIN2D: N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are a class of ionotropic glutamate
        receptors. NMDA channel has been shown to be involved in long-term potentiation,
        an activity-dependent increase in the efficiency of synaptic transmission
        thought to underlie certain kinds of memory and learning. NMDA receptor channels
        are heteromers composed of the key receptor subunit NMDAR1 (GRIN1) and 1 or
        more of the 4 NMDAR2 subunits: N...


        CACNA1C: This gene encodes an alpha-1 subunit of a voltage-dependent calcium
        channel. Calcium channels mediate the influx of calcium ions into the cell
        upon membrane polarization. The alpha-1 subunit consists of 24 transmembrane
        segments and forms the pore through which ions pass into the cell. The calcium
        channel consists of a complex of alpha-1, alpha-2/delta, beta, and gamma subunits
        in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. There are multiple isoforms of each of these proteins,
        either encoded by different genes or the result of alternative splicing of
        transcripts. The protein encoded by this gene binds to and is inhibited by
        dihydropyridine. Alternative splicing results in ...


        SLC8A1: In cardiac myocytes, Ca(2+) concentrations alternate between high
        levels during contraction and low levels during relaxation. The increase in
        Ca(2+) concentration during contraction is primarily due to release of Ca(2+)
        from intracellular stores. However, some Ca(2+) also enters the cell through
        the sarcolemma (plasma membrane). During relaxation, Ca(2+) is sequestered
        within the intracellular stores. To prevent overloading of intracellular stores,
        the Ca(2+) that entered across the sarcolemma must be extruded from the cell.
        The Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger is the primary mechanism by which the Ca(2+) is
        extruded from the cell during relaxation. In the heart, the exchanger may
        play a k...

        (NMDA) receptor. The encoded protein is found primarily in motor neurons,
        where it forms a heterotetramer with GRIN1 to create an excitatory glycine
        receptor. Variations in this gene have been pr...

        Here are the gene summaries:



        P2RX7: The product of this gene belongs to the family of purinoceptors for
        ATP. This receptor functions as a ligand-gated ion channel and is responsible
        for ATP-dependent lysis of macrophages through the formation of membrane pores
        permeable to large molecules. Activation of this nuclear receptor by ATP in
        the cytoplasm may be a mechanism by which cellular activity can be coupled
        to changes in gene expression. Multiple alternatively spliced variant...


        CHRNA10: Predicted to enable acetylcholine-gated cation-selective channel
        activity. Acts upstream of or within positive regulation of cytosolic calcium
        ion concentration. Predicted to be located in membrane. Predicted to be active
        in cholinergic synapse and neuron projection. Predicted to be integral component
        of postsynapt...


        GPM6A: Predicted to enable calcium channel activity. Involved in neuron migration
        and stem cell differentiation. Located in extracellular exosome. [provided
        by ...


        GRIN2A: This gene encodes a member of the glutamate-gated ion channel protein
        family. The encoded protein is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit.
        NMDA receptors are both ligand-gated and voltage-dependent, and are involved
        in long-term potentiation, an activity-dependent increase in the efficiency
        of synaptic transmission thought to underlie certain kinds of memory and learning.
        These receptors are permeable to calcium ions, and activation results in a
        calcium influx into post-synaptic cells, which results in the activation of
        several signaling cascades. Disruption of this gene is associated with focal
        epil...


        GRIN3A: This gene encodes a subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors,
        which belong to the superfamily of glutamate-regulated ion channels, and function
        in physiological and pathological processes in the central nervous system.
        This subunit shows greater than 90% identity to the corresponding subunit
        in rat. Studies in the knockout mouse deficient in this subunit suggest that
        this gene may be involved in t...


        CHRNA7: The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are members of a superfamily
        of ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast signal transmission at synapses.
        The nAChRs are thought to be hetero-pentamers composed of homologous subunits.
        The proposed structure for each subunit is a conserved N-terminal extracellular
        domain followed by three conserved transmembrane domains, a variable cytoplasmic
        loop, a fourth conserved transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal extracellular
        region. The protein encoded by this gene forms a homo-oligomeric channel,
        displays marked permeability to calcium ions and is a major component of brain
        nicotinic receptors that are blocked by, and highly sensitive to, alpha-bungarotoxin.
        Once this receptor binds acetylcholine, it undergoes an extensive change in
        conformation that affects all subunits and leads to opening of an ion-conducting
        channel across the plasma membrane. This gene is located in a region identified
        as a major susceptibility locus for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and a chromosomal
        location involved in the genetic ...


        CACNG4: The protein encoded by this gene is a type I transmembrane AMPA receptor
        regulatory protein (TARP). TARPs regulate both trafficking and channel gating
        of the AMPA receptors. This gene is part of a functionally diverse eight-member
        protein subfamily of the PMP-22/EMP/MP20 family and is located in a cluster
        with two family members,...


        P2RX4: The product of this gene belongs to the family of purinoceptors for
        ATP. This receptor functions as a ligand-gated ion channel with high calcium
        permeability. The main pharmacological distinction between the members of
        the purinoceptor family is the relative sensitivity to the antagonists suramin
        and PPADS. The product of this gene has the lowest sensitivity for these antagonists.
        Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants, ...


        ITPR1: This gene encodes an intracellular receptor for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.
        Upon stimulation by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, this receptor mediates calcium
        release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutations in this gene cause spinocerebellar
        ataxia type 15, a disease associated with an heterogeneous group of cerebellar
        disorders. Multiple ...


        F2R: Coagulation factor II receptor is a 7-transmembrane receptor involved
        in the regulation of thrombotic response. Proteolytic cleavage leads to the
        activation of the receptor. F2R is a G-protein coupled receptor family member.
        Alternative splicing results...


        ATP2B2: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the family of P-type primary
        ion transport ATPases characterized by the formation of an aspartyl phosphate
        intermediate during the reaction cycle. These enzymes remove bivalent calcium
        ions from eukaryotic cells against very large concentration gradients and
        play a critical role in intracellular calcium homeostasis. The mammalian plasma
        membrane calcium ATPase isoforms are encoded by at least four separate genes
        and the diversity of these enzymes is further increased by alternative splicing
        of transcripts. The expression of different isoforms and splice variants is
        regulated in a developmental, tissue- and cell type-specific manner, suggesting
        that these pumps are functionally adapted to the physiological needs of particular
        cells an...


        GRIN2D: N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are a class of ionotropic glutamate
        receptors. NMDA channel has been shown to be involved in long-term potentiation,
        an activity-dependent increase in the efficiency of synaptic transmission
        thought to underlie certain kinds of memory and learning. NMDA receptor channels
        are heteromers composed of the key receptor subunit NMDAR1 (GRIN1) and 1 or
        more of the 4 NMDAR2 subunits: N...


        CACNA1C: This gene encodes an alpha-1 subunit of a voltage-dependent calcium
        channel. Calcium channels mediate the influx of calcium ions into the cell
        upon membrane polarization. The alpha-1 subunit consists of 24 transmembrane

        channel consists of a complex of alpha-1, alpha-2/delta, beta, and gamma subunits
        in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. There are multiple isoforms of each of these proteins,
        either encoded by different genes or the result of alternative splicing of
        transcripts. The protein encoded by this gene binds to and is inhibited by

        SLC8A1: In cardiac myocytes, Ca(2+) concentrations alternate between high
        levels during contraction and low levels during relaxation. The increase in
        Ca(2+) concentration during contraction is primarily due to release of Ca(2+)
        from intracellular stores. However, some Ca(2+) also enters the cell through
        the sarcolemma (plasma membrane). During relaxation, Ca(2+) is sequestered
        within the intracellular stores. To prevent overloading of intracellular stores,
        the Ca(2+) that entered across the sarcolemma must be extruded from the cell.
        The Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger is the primary mechanism by which the Ca(2+) is
        extruded from the cell during relaxation. In the heart, the exchanger may
        play a k...

        PSEN1: Alzheimer''s disease (AD) patients with an inherited form of the disease
        carry mutations in the presenilin proteins (PSEN1; PSEN2) or in the amyloid
        precursor protein (APP). These disease-linked mutations result in increased
        production of the longer form of amyloid-beta (main component of amyloid deposits
        found in AD brains). Presenilins are postulated to regulate APP processing
        through their effects on gamma-secretase, an enzyme that cleaves APP. Also,
        it is thought that the presenilins are involved in the cleavage of the Notch
        receptor, such that they either directly regulate gamma-secretase activity
        or themselves are protease enzymes. Several alternatively spliced tr...


        GRIN1: The protein encoded by this gene is a critical subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate
        receptors, members of the glutamate receptor channel superfamily which are
        heteromeric protein complexes with multiple subunits arranged to form a ligand-gated
        ion channel. These subunits play a key role in the plasticity of synapses,
        which is believed to underlie memory and learning. Cell-specific factors are
        thought to control expression of different isoforms, possibly contributing
        to the functional...


        GRIN2C: This gene encodes a subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor,
        which is a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptor. NMDA receptors are found
        in the central nervous system, are permeable to cations and have an important
        role in physiological processes such as learning, memory, and synaptic development.
        The receptor is a tetramer of different subunits (typically heterodimer of
        subunit 1 with one or more of subunits 2A-D), forming a channel that is permeable
        to calcium, potassium, and sodium, and whose properties are determined by
        subunit composition. Alterations in the subunit composition of the receptor
        are associated with pathophysiological conditions such...

        this gene causes myoclonus dystonia; other mutations have been associated
        with schizophrenia. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript
        variants encoding different isoforms. A third variant has been described,

        with response to the antidepressant citalopram in patients with major depressive
        disorder (MDD). MDD patients who also have a mutation in intron 2 of this
        gene show a significantly reduced response to citalopram as this antidepressant

        GRIN2B: This gene encodes a member of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
        family within the ionotropic glutamate receptor superfamily. The encoded protein
        is a subunit of the NMDA receptor ion channel which acts as an agonist binding
        site for glutamate. The NMDA receptors mediate a slow calcium-permeable component
        of excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The NMDA
        receptors are heterotetramers of seven genetically encoded, differentially
        expressed subunits including NR1 (GRIN1), NR2 (GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, or
        GRIN2D) and NR3 (GRIN3A or GRIN3B). The early expression of this gene in development
        suggests a role in brain development, circuit formation, synaptic plasticity,
        and cellular migration and differentiation. Naturally occurring mutations
        within ...


        ATP2B1: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the family of P-type primary
        ion transport ATPases characterized by the formation of an aspartyl phosphate
        intermediate during the reaction cycle. These enzymes remove bivalent calcium
        ions from eukaryotic cells against very large concentration gradients and
        play a critical role in intracellular calcium homeostasis. The mammalian plasma
        membrane calcium ATPase isoforms are encoded by at least four separate genes
        and the diversity of these enzymes is further increased by alternative splicing
        of transcripts. The expression of different isoforms and splice variants is
        regulated in a developmental, tissue- and cell type-specific manner, suggesting
        that these pumps are functionally adapted to the physiological needs of particular
        cells an...


        TRPV1: Capsaicin, the main pungent ingredient in hot chili peppers, elicits
        a sensation of burning pain by selectively activating sensory neurons that
        convey information about noxious stimuli to the central nervous system. The
        protein encoded by this gene is a receptor for capsaicin and is a non-selective
        cation channel that is structurally related to members of the TRP family of
        ion channels. This receptor is also activated by increases in temperature
        in the noxious range, suggesting that it functions as a transducer of painful
        thermal stimuli in vivo. Four transc...

        protein is involved in cochlea hair cell development and is also expressed
        in the...


        NCS1: This gene is a member of the neuronal calcium sensor gene family, which
        encode calcium-binding proteins expressed predominantly in neurons. The protein
        encoded by this gene regulates G protein-coupled receptor phosphorylation
        in a calcium-dependent manner and can substitute for calmodulin. The protein
        is associated with secretory granules and modulates synaptic transmission
        and synaptic plasticity. Multiple trans...

        Here are the gene summaries:



        P2RX7: The product of this gene belongs to the family of purinoceptors for
        ATP. This receptor functions as a ligand-gated ion channel and is responsible
        for ATP-dependent lysis of macrophages through the formation of membrane pores
        permeable to large molecules. Activation of this nuclear receptor by ATP in
        the cytoplasm may be a mechanism by which cellular activity can be coupled
        to changes in gene expression. Multiple alternatively spliced variant...

        activity. Acts upstream of or within positive regulation of cytosolic calcium
        ion concentration. Predicted to be located in membrane. Predicted to be active
        in cholinergic synapse and neuron projection. Predicted to be integral component
        of postsynapt...


        GPM6A: Predicted to enable calcium channel activity. Involved in neuron migration
        and stem cell differentiation. Located in extracellular exosome. [provided
        by ...


        GRIN2A: This gene encodes a member of the glutamate-gated ion channel protein
        family. The encoded protein is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit.
        NMDA receptors are both ligand-gated and voltage-dependent, and are involved
        in long-term potentiation, an activity-dependent increase in the efficiency
        of synaptic transmission thought to underlie certain kinds of memory and learning.
        These receptors are permeable to calcium ions, and activation results in a
        calcium influx into post-synaptic cells, which results in the activation of
        several signaling cascades. Disruption of this gene is associated with focal
        epil...


        GRIN3A: This gene encodes a subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors,
        which belong to the superfamily of glutamate-regulated ion channels, and function
        in physiological and pathological processes in the central nervous system.
        This subunit shows greater than 90% identity to the corresponding subunit
        in rat. Studies in the knockout mouse deficient in this subunit suggest that
        this gene may be involved in t...


        CHRNA7: The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are members of a superfamily
        of ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast signal transmission at synapses.
        The nAChRs are thought to be hetero-pentamers composed of homologous subunits.
        The proposed structure for each subunit is a conserved N-terminal extracellular
        domain followed by three conserved transmembrane domains, a variable cytoplasmic
        loop, a fourth conserved transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal extracellular
        region. The protein encoded by this gene forms a homo-oligomeric channel,
        displays marked permeability to calcium ions and is a major component of brain
        nicotinic receptors that are blocked by, and highly sensitive to, alpha-bungarotoxin.
        Once this receptor binds acetylcholine, it undergoes an extensive change in
        conformation that affects all subunits and leads to opening of an ion-conducting
        channel across the plasma membrane. This gene is located in a region identified
        as a major susceptibility locus for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and a chromosomal
        location involved in the genetic ...

        protein subfamily of the PMP-22/EMP/MP20 family and is located in a cluster
        with two family members,...


        P2RX4: The product of this gene belongs to the family of purinoceptors for
        ATP. This receptor functions as a ligand-gated ion channel with high calcium
        permeability. The main pharmacological distinction between the members of
        the purinoceptor family is the relative sensitivity to the antagonists suramin
        and PPADS. The product of this gene has the lowest sensitivity for these antagonists.
        Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants, ...


        ITPR1: This gene encodes an intracellular receptor for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.
        Upon stimulation by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, this receptor mediates calcium
        release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutations in this gene cause spinocerebellar
        ataxia type 15, a disease associated with an heterogeneous group of cerebellar
        disorders. Multiple ...


        F2R: Coagulation factor II receptor is a 7-transmembrane receptor involved
        in the regulation of thrombotic response. Proteolytic cleavage leads to the

        GRIN2D: N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are a class of ionotropic glutamate
        receptors. NMDA channel has been shown to be involved in long-term potentiation,
        an activity-dependent increase in the efficiency of synaptic transmission
        thought to underlie certain kinds of memory and learning. NMDA receptor channels
        are heteromers composed of the key receptor subunit NMDAR1 (GRIN1) and 1 or
        more of the 4 NMDAR2 subunits: N...


        CACNA1C: This gene encodes an alpha-1 subunit of a voltage-dependent calcium
        channel. Calcium channels mediate the influx of calcium ions into the cell
        upon membrane polarization. The alpha-1 subunit consists of 24 transmembrane
        segments and forms the pore through which ions pass into the cell. The calcium
        channel consists of a complex of alpha-1, alpha-2/delta, beta, and gamma subunits

        site for glutamate. The NMDA receptors mediate a slow calcium-permeable component
        of excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The NMDA
        receptors are heterotetramers of seven genetically encoded, differentially
        expressed subunits including NR1 (GRIN1), NR2 (GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, or
        GRIN2D) and NR3 (GRIN3A or GRIN3B). The early expression of this gene in development
        suggests a role in brain development, circuit formation, synaptic plasticity,
        and cellular migration and differentiation. Naturally occurring mutations

        ATP2B1: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the family of P-type primary
        ion transport ATPases characterized by the formation of an aspartyl phosphate
        intermediate during the reaction cycle. These enzymes remove bivalent calcium
        ions from eukaryotic cells against very large concentration gradients and
        play a critical role in intracellular calcium homeostasis. The mammalian plasma
        membrane calcium ATPase isoforms are encoded by at least four separate genes
        and the diversity of these enzymes is further increased by alternative splicing
        of transcripts. The expression of different isoforms and splice variants is
        regulated in a developmental, tissue- and cell type-specific manner, suggesting
        that these pumps are functionally adapted to the physiological needs of particular
        cells an...


        TRPV1: Capsaicin, the main pungent ingredient in hot chili peppers, elicits
        a sensation of burning pain by selectively activating sensory neurons that
        convey information about noxious stimuli to the central nervous system. The
        protein encoded by this gene is a receptor for capsaicin and is a non-selective
        cation channel that is structurally related to members of the TRP family of
        ion channels. This receptor is also activated by increases in temperature
        in the noxious range, suggesting that it functions as a transducer of painful
        thermal stimuli in vivo. Four transc...


        CHRNA9: This gene is a member of the ligand-gated ionic channel family and
        nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene superfamily. It encodes a plasma membrane
        protein that forms homo- or hetero-oligomeric divalent cation channels. This
        protein is involved in cochlea hair cell development and is also expressed
        in the...


        NCS1: This gene is a member of the neuronal calcium sensor gene family, which
        encode calcium-binding proteins expressed predominantly in neurons. The protein
        encoded by this gene regulates G protein-coupled receptor phosphorylation
        in a calcium-dependent manner and can substitute for calmodulin. The protein
        is associated with secretory granules and modulates synaptic transmission
        and synaptic plasticity. Multiple trans...
