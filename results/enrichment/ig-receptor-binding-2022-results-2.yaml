      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        IGHM: Immunoglobulins (Ig) are the antigen recognition molecules of B cells.
        An Ig molecule is made up of 2 identical heavy chains and 2 identical light
        chains (see MIM 147200) joined by disulfide bonds so that each heavy chain
        is linked to a light chain and the 2 heavy chains are linked together. Each
        Ig heavy chain has an N-terminal variable (V) region containing the antigen-binding
        site and a C-terminal constant (C) region, encoded by an individual C region
        gene, that determines the isotype of the antibody and provides effector or
        signaling functions. The heavy chain V region is encoded by 1 each of 3 types
        of genes: V genes (see M...

        TRDC: T cell receptors recognize foreign antigens which have been processed
        as small peptides and bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules
        at the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC). Each T cell receptor is
        a dimer consisting of one alpha and one beta chain or one delta and one gamma
        chain. In a single cell, the T cell receptor loci are rearranged and expressed
        in the order delta, gamma, beta, and alpha. If both delta and gamma rearrangements
        produce functional chains, the cell expresses delta and gamma. If not, the
        cell proceeds to rearrange the beta and alpha loci. This region represents
        the germline organization of the T cell receptor alpha and delta loci. Both
        the alpha and delta loci include V (variable),...

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.


        Provide results in the format


        Summary: <high level summary>

        Mechanism: <mechanism>

        Enriched Terms: <term1>; <term2>; <term3>


        For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number
        the list.

        Always put the list of terms last, after mechanism, summary, or hypotheses.

        IGHM: Immunoglobulins (Ig) are the antigen recognition molecules of B cells.
        An Ig molecule is made up of 2 identical heavy chains and 2 identical light
        chains (see MIM 147200) joined by disulfide bonds so that each heavy chain
        is linked to a light chain and the 2 heavy chains are linked together. Each
        Ig heavy chain has an N-terminal variable (V) region containing the antigen-binding
        site and a C-terminal constant (C) region, encoded by an individual C region
        gene, that determines the isotype of the antibody and provides effector or
        signaling functions. The heavy chain V region is encoded by 1 each of 3 types
        of genes: V genes (see M...

        TRDC: T cell receptors recognize foreign antigens which have been processed
        as small peptides and bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules
        at the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC). Each T cell receptor is
        a dimer consisting of one alpha and one beta chain or one delta and one gamma
        chain. In a single cell, the T cell receptor loci are rearranged and expressed
        in the order delta, gamma, beta, and alpha. If both delta and gamma rearrangements
        produce functional chains, the cell expresses delta and gamma. If not, the
        cell proceeds to rearrange the beta and alpha loci. This region represents
        the germline organization of the T cell receptor alpha and delta loci. Both
        the alpha and delta loci include V (variable),...

        Summary: The human genes described in this list have enriched terms related
        to binding and receptor binding activity, antigen binding activity, immunoglobulin
        receptor binding activity, non-membrane spanning protein tyrosine kinase activity,
        phosphatidylcholine binding activity, and phosphotyrosine residue binding
        activity.

        Mechanism: These genes are involved in a variety of biological processes,
        including immunoglobulin receptor binding, protein phosphorylation, antigen
        binding, and cellular component organization. These genes likely work together
        to enable the body to respond to antigens as part of the immune system. This
        includes recognizing antigens and binding to them so that the body can mount
        an immune response.

        as small peptides and bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules
        at the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC). Each T cell receptor is
        a dimer consisting of one alpha and one beta chain or one delta and one gamma
        chain. In a single cell, the T cell receptor loci are rearranged and expressed
        in the order delta, gamma, beta, and alpha. If both delta and gamma rearrangements
        produce functional chains, the cell expresses delta and gamma. If not, the
        cell proceeds to rearrange the beta and alpha loc...

        Analysis of the 20 human genes revealed a significant enrichment of terms
        relating to immunity, including antigen binding activity, immunoglobulin receptor
        binding activity, antibody production, adaptive immune response, and protein
        homodimerization.

        Mechanism: These genes enable immune system detection and responses to foreign
        antigens, as well as the recognition and binding of antigens and immunoglobulins.
        Through somatic recombination of genes, antigen recognition and specificity
        can be achieved, eventually leading to the production of antibodies.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        IGHM: Immunoglobulins (Ig) are the antigen recognition molecules of B cells.
        An Ig molecule is made up of 2 identical heavy chains and 2 identical light
        chains (see MIM 147200) joined by disulfide bonds so that each heavy chain
        is linked to a light chain and the 2 heavy chains are linked together. Each
        Ig heavy chain has an N-terminal variable (V) region containing the antigen-binding
        site and a C-terminal constant (C) region, encoded by an individual C region
        gene, that determines the isotype of the antibody ...

        TRDC: T cell receptors recognize foreign antigens which have been processed
        as small peptides and bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules
        at the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC). Each T cell receptor is
        a dimer consisting of one alpha and one beta chain or one delta and one gamma
        chain. In a single cell, the T cell receptor loci are rearranged and expressed
        in the order delta, gamma, beta, and alpha. If both delta and gamma rearrangements
        produce functional chains, the cell expresses delta and gamma. If not, the
        cell proceeds to rearrange the beta and alpha loc...

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        TRDC: T cell receptors recognize foreign antigens which have been processed
        as small peptides and bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules
        at the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC). Each T cell receptor is
        a dimer consisting of one alpha and one beta chain or one delta and one gamma
        chain. In a single cell, the T cell receptor loci are rearranged and expressed
        in the order delta, gamma, beta, and alpha. If both delta and gamma rearrangements
        produce functional chains, the cell expresses delta and gamma. If not, the
        cell proceeds to rearrange the beta and alpha loci. This region represents
        the germline organization of the T cell receptor alpha and delta loci. Both
        the alpha and delta loci include V (variable),...

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        TRDC: T cell receptors recognize foreign antigens which have been processed
        as small peptides and bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules
        at the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC). Each T cell receptor is
        a dimer consisting of one alpha and one beta chain or one delta and one gamma
        chain. In a single cell, the T cell receptor loci are rearranged and expressed
        in the order delta, gamma, beta, and alpha. If both delta and gamma rearrangements
        produce functional chains, the cell expresses delta and gamma. If not, the
        cell proceeds to rearrange the beta and alpha loci. This region represents
        the germline organization of the T cell receptor alpha and delta loci. Both
        the alpha and delta loci include V (variable),...

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        TRDC: T cell receptors recognize foreign antigens which have been processed
        as small peptides and bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules
        at the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC). Each T cell receptor is
        a dimer consisting of one alpha and one beta chain or one delta and one gamma
        chain. In a single cell, the T cell receptor loci are rearranged and expressed
        in the order delta, gamma, beta, and alpha. If both delta and gamma rearrangements
        produce functional chains, the cell expresses delta and gamma. If not, the
        cell proceeds to rearrange the beta and alpha loci. This region represents
        the germline organization of the T cell receptor alpha and delta loci. Both
        the alpha and delta loci include V (variable),...

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.


        Provide results in the format


        Summary: <high level summary>

        Mechanism: <mechanism>

        Enriched Terms: <term1>; <term2>; <term3>


        For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number
        the list.

        Always put the list of terms last, after mechanism, summary, or hypotheses.

        TRDC: T cell receptors recognize foreign antigens which have been processed
        as small peptides and bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules
        at the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC). Each T cell receptor is
        a dimer consisting of one alpha and one beta chain or one delta and one gamma
        chain. In a single cell, the T cell receptor loci are rearranged and expressed
        in the order delta, gamma, beta, and alpha. If both delta and gamma rearrangements
        produce functional chains, the cell expresses delta and gamma. If not, the
        cell proceeds to rearrange the beta and alpha loci. This region represents
        the germline organization of the T cell receptor alpha and delta loci. Both
        the alpha and delta loci include V (variable),...
