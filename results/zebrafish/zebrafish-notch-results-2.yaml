        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

      response_text: ' The genes analyzed in this term enrichment test are related
        to structures involved in cell development and proliferation, particularly
        in the context of the Notch signaling pathway. The most highly enriched terms
        include Notch signaling pathway (Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, and other related
        genes), digit development (Hey1, Hey2, FSD1, JAG1a, JAG1b, and others), and
        morphogenesis (NRARPA, NLE1, DAB2, WNT16, and DBL).


        Mechanism: The underlying biological mechanism involves a series of signaling
        pathways, particularly the Notch pathway. Notch pathway components activate
        and activate certain genes, which in turns leads to the development and proliferation

        of various cellular processes such as cell differentiation and proliferation,
        tissue development, and maintenance. Notch receptors interact with their ligands
        (Jagged and Delta-like proteins) to activate a signaling cascade leading to
        the transcriptional regulation of target genes. This cascade involves various
        transcription factors, co-factors, and enzymes, such as RBPJ, HIF1A, MAML,
        and ADAM metallopeptidases. Dysregulation of the Notch pathway has been implicated
        in several diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders.'

        the interaction of Notch receptors with Jagged and Delta-like ligands, which

        migration. Mechanism: The underlying biological mechanism is related to the
        regulation of key biological pathways involved in cell communication, gene
        expression, development, and signaling. This is achieved through the binding
        of transcription factors, the modulation of signal transduction pathways,
        and the differential expression of specific genes involved in these processes.'

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.
