        enzymes responsible for initiating the apoptotic signal. Additionally, the
        genes expressed in apoptosis also serve to control the process by regulating
        various factors associated with the cell death process, such as the phosphatidylserine
        exposure on the apoptotic cell surface. The commonality between these genes
        suggests that they are regulating the process of apoptosis in some way.
