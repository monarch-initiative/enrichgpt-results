        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.


        Provide results in the format


        Summary: <high level summary>

        Mechanism: <mechanism>

        Enriched Terms: <term1>; <term2>; <term3>


        For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number
        the list.

        Always put the list of terms last, after mechanism, summary, or hypotheses.

      summary: ' The majority of these genes are predicted to enable DNA and ATP-dependent
        activities, such as DNA binding activity, DNA topoisomerase type II (double
        strand cut, ATP-hydrolyzing) activity, DNA polymerase binding activity, DNA
        endonuclease activity, and single-stranded DNA endodeoxyribonuclease activity.
        Their functions are associated with processes such as homologous chromosome
        pairing at meiosis, DNA repair, DNA recombination, meiotic cell cycle, resolution
        of meiotic recombination intermediates, and synaptonemal complex assembly.


        Mechanism:These genes are likely involved in the regulation of the meiotic
        process, ensuring the accurate and efficient formation of gametes to ensure
        faithful transmission of the genetic information to the next generation.
