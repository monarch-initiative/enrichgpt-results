        Summary: The genes UPC2 and LHS1 share the common function of transcription
        regulation in plants.

        Mechanism: Transcriptional regulation is the process by which transcription
        factors interact with cis-elements to control gene expression.

        UPC2 and LHS1 likely interact with other transcription factors as part of
