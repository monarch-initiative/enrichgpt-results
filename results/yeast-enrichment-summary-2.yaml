        the list suggests a potential role of these processes in cellular homeostasis
        and adaptation. Autophagy is a catabolic process that removes cellular components,
        including proteins, lipids, and organelles, and recycles them for energy generation
        and biosynthesis. Vesicle trafficking, on the other hand, is essential for
        the transport of various molecules, including proteins and lipids, between
        organelles to maintain their proper function. The regulation of autophagy
        and vesicle trafficking is highly complex and involves numerous factors, including
        the genes in this list. The enrichment of these genes suggests that autophagy
        and vesicle trafficking may be interconnected and regulated by common mechanisms
        in S cerevisiae. Additionally, disruption of these processes may lead to the
        development of various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and
        cancer, highlighting the importance of studying autophagy and'

        for localizing additional ATG proteins to the PAS; required for overflow degradation
        of misfolded proteins when ERAD is saturated; homolog of human Barkor; other
        members are Vps34, Vps15, and Vps30p


        ATG11: Adapter protein for pexophagy and the Cvt targeting pathway; directs
        receptor-bound cargo to the phagophore assembly site (PAS) for packaging into
        vesicles; required for recruiting other proteins to the PAS; recruits Dnm1p
        to facilitate fission of mitochondria that are destined for removal by mitophagy


        COG4: Essential component of the conserved oligomeric Golgi complex; a cytosolic
        tethering complex (Cog1p through Cog8p) that functions in protein trafficking
        to mediate fusion of transport vesicles to Golgi compartments


        ATG18: Phosphoinositide binding protein; required for vesicle formation in
        autophagy and the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (CVT) pathway; binds PtdIns(3,5)P2,
        PI3P and PI4P; WD-40 repeat containing protein and PROPPIN family member;
        relocalizes from the vacuole to cytoplasm upon DNA replication stress; mammalian
        homologs include: WIPI1, WIPI2, WIPI3 and WIPI4/WDR45; mutations in human
        WDR45 cause static encephalopathy of childhood with neurodegeneration in adulthood

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Summary and enriched terms:'
      response_text: 'Summary: Endocytosis and protein transport are enriched terms
        in this list of S. cerevisiae genes.


        Mechanism: These genes play important roles in protein transport and endocytosis
        pathways in S. cerevisiae cells.


        Enriched Terms: Endocytosis; Protein transport; Clathrin-dependent endocytosis;
        Golgi to plasma membrane transport; Vesicle fusion; Actin cortical patch assembly;
        Ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis; Plasma membrane protein import; Phosphatidylinositol
        dephosphorylation; Late endosome to vacuole transport via multivesicular body;
        Reticulophagy; Autophagy of peroxisome.


        Hypothesis: These genes are involved in regulating the internalization, sorting,
        and recycling of plasma membrane proteins, as well as the transport of cargo
        proteins to various intracellular compartments. Protein-protein interactions
        mediated by ubiquitin binding domains could play a central role in these processes,
        along with the actin cytoskeleton dynamics and clathrin-coated vesicle formation.
        Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways might contribute to the
        regulation of these processes, since several of the genes in the list encode

        of their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        of their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Enriched Terms: Endocytosis; Vesicle trafficking; Clathrin-mediated endocytosis;
        Protein transport; Actin cytoskeleton organization; Membrane organization


        Mechanism: These genes are all involved in the processes surrounding endocytosis,
        which is the process by which cells internalize substances from the extracellular
        environment. Specifically, they are involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis,
        which is one of the major pathways for endocytosis in eukaryotic cells. This
        pathway involves the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles, which are involved
        in a variety of processes including protein transport and membrane organization.
        Many of the genes in this list are involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton,
        which is necessary for the formation and movement of clathrin-coated vesicles.
        Overall, the enriched terms suggest that these genes are involved in various
        aspects of endocytosis and vesicle trafficking, including regulation of protein
        transport, organization of the actin cytoskeleton, and membrane organization.'

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        The two genes, YBL055C and NUC1, are associated with DNA repair and the maintenance
        of genomic stability. Specifically, they have been found to be involved in
        transcription-coupled repair (TCR), mismatch repair (MMR), and DNA repair
        pathways such as homologous recombination and nucleotide excision repair (NER).


        Mechanism: These two genes interact in the regulation of DNA repair pathways.
        They are involved in the maintenance of genome stability, as well as transcription-coupled
        repair (TCR) and mismatch repair (MMR) in particular.

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

      response_text: ' Based on the information provided, it appears that both YBL055C
        genes are involved in cutting and shearing DNA in a process known as apoptosis.
        Apoptosis is a form of cell death typically used to regulate the number of
        cells in a given tissue. Enriched terms include: apoptosis; nucleases; endonuclease;
        3''-->5'' exonuclease.


        Mechanism: Apoptosis is a regulated cell death pathway controlled by a variety
        of proteins, including YBL055C genes. These proteins function by cutting and
        shearing DNA and typically result in the fragmentation of the nucleus and
        other cell structures. This fragmentation reduces the size and complexity
        of the cell, allowing for the controlled and regulated death of the cell.'

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        \ proper DNA replication, segregation, and processing of both sister chromatids.\
        \ Chromatin remodeling is also suggested to be involved, as IPL1, MIF2, and\
        \ MAM1 have been found to play roles in the chromatin structure and regulation\
        \ of transcription in eukaryotes. Furthermore, some genes are associated with\

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.


        Provide results in the format


        Summary: <high level summary>

        Mechanism: <mechanism>

        Enriched Terms: <term1>; <term2>; <term3>


        For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number
        the list.

        Always put the list of terms last, after mechanism, summary, or hypotheses.

        Mechanism: Peroxisome biogenesis and maintenance pathway.


        Hypothesis:  The genes in the list are all related to peroxisome organization
        and biogenesis, which suggests an underlying pathway for peroxisome biogenesis
        and maintenance. These genes are involved in processes such as peroxisome
        organization, biogenesis, and fission, and are likely part of a coordinated
        mechanism for the regulation and maintenance of peroxisomes in cells. Further
        research into these genes and the associated pathway could shed light on peroxisome-related

        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.

      prompt: 'I will give you a list of human genes  together with descriptions of
        their functions.

        Perform a term enrichment test on these genes.

        i.e. tell me what the commonalities are in their function.

        Make use of classification hierarchies when you do this.

        Only report gene functions in common, not diseases.

        e.g if gene1 is involved in "toe bone growth" and gene2 is involved in "finger
        morphogenesis"

        then the term "digit development" would be enriched as represented by gene1
        and gene2.

        Only include terms that are statistically over-represented.

        Also include a hypothesis of the underlying biological mechanism or pathway.


        Provide results in the format

        For the list of terms, be sure to use a semi-colon separator, and do not number
        the list.

        Always put the list of terms last, after mechanism, summary, or hypotheses.
